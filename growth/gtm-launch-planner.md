# GTM Launch Planner

Creates comprehensive go-to-market launch plans with positioning, channel strategy, timeline, launch day playbook, and success metrics for product launches, feature releases, or market expansions.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~15 min Claude session → ~60-120 min implementing in your product / tools. If implementing the full launch plan, add weeks of execution time. Input is product/feature info and launch goals. Output is Markdown GTM plan with timeline and checklist.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Plan a go-to-market strategy for our new product" (full GTM)
- "Feature launch playbook" (feature release)
- "How to launch in a new market" (market expansion)
- "Launch timeline for Q2" (timeline)
- "Launch readiness checklist" (pre-launch)
- "Beta launch strategy" (early-stage)
- "Waitlist and pre-launch buzz strategy" (pre-launch marketing)
- "Launch day playbook" (day-of execution)
- "Post-launch measurement plan" (post-launch)
- "Compare launch strategies: big bang vs. soft launch" (strategic)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Product/Feature | Text | What you're launching and its key value proposition |
| Target Market | Text | Who it's for, market size estimate |
| Launch Date | Text | Target launch date or timeframe |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No positioning yet?** Describe the problem you solve and for whom. Claude will draft positioning as part of the plan.
- **No launch date?** Claude builds a "time-to-launch" plan with recommended milestones. Work backward from when you want to be in market.
- **No marketing budget?** Claude includes zero-cost tactics (PR, community, partnerships) alongside paid options. Specify budget constraints.
- **No competitive analysis?** Describe your top 3 competitors at a high level. Claude positions against them.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Budget | Number | Marketing budget for launch |
| Competitive Landscape | Text | Key competitors and their positioning |
| Existing Audience | Text | Email list size, social following, community |
| Sales Team | Text | Direct sales vs. self-serve vs. hybrid |
| Previous Launches | Text | What worked/didn't in past launches |

## Process

### Step 1: Launch Strategy Selection
| Strategy | When to Use | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|
| Big Bang | Major product launch, strong brand, large audience | High (all-or-nothing) |
| Phased Rollout | New market, complex product, limited resources | Medium |
| Soft Launch | Beta testing, MVP validation, regulated industry | Low |
| Waitlist/Pre-Launch | Building anticipation, supply-constrained, viral potential | Medium |

### Step 2: Positioning & Messaging
- One-liner positioning statement
- 3 key messages (benefit-driven)
- Competitive differentiation (why you vs. alternatives)
- Proof points (data, testimonials, case studies)

### Step 3: Channel Plan
Map channels to launch phases:
- **Pre-Launch (4-8 weeks)**: Email tease, social hints, PR outreach, influencer seeding
- **Launch Week**: Press release, blog post, social blitz, email blast, paid ads
- **Post-Launch (2-4 weeks)**: Content marketing, case studies, retargeting, community engagement

### Step 4: Timeline & Milestones
Build a week-by-week timeline:
- T-8 weeks: Finalize positioning and messaging
- T-6 weeks: Create launch assets (landing page, email, social, press kit)
- T-4 weeks: Begin pre-launch marketing
- T-2 weeks: Media outreach, influencer activation
- T-1 week: Final testing, team briefing, launch day playbook
- Launch Day: Execute playbook
- T+1-4 weeks: Monitor, optimize, follow-up content

### Step 5: Launch Day Playbook
Hour-by-hour execution plan:
- Pre-market: Final checks, team standup
- Launch hour: Publish blog, send emails, post social, activate PR
- Mid-day: Monitor metrics, respond to coverage, engage comments
- End-of-day: First metrics report, team debrief

### Step 6: Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | PR mentions, social impressions, website traffic spike |
| Acquisition | Signups, downloads, trials, purchases in first 7/30 days |
| Activation | Users reaching aha moment in first 7 days |
| Revenue | Revenue in first 30/60/90 days |
| Sentiment | Social sentiment, NPS, support ticket volume |

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Launch success is hard to predict. Even well-planned launches can underperform if market timing is off or if the product doesn't resonate. Plan for scenarios: what if launch exceeds expectations (scaling plan) AND what if it underperforms (pivot plan). Set realistic expectations — most launches see a spike followed by a dip before finding steady state.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review positioning with actual customers before launch. Verify all legal/compliance requirements (regulatory approvals, terms of service, privacy policy updates). Ensure customer support is staffed for launch-day volume. Test all links, tracking, and landing pages before go-live.

> **Benchmark Context**: Good Day 1 retention is 20-30% for mobile apps and 40%+ for strong SaaS products (Amplitude/Mixpanel 2025 Benchmarks). Median net revenue retention for SaaS is ~110% (Bessemer Venture Partners 2025).

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Project Management (Asana/Notion/Linear)
1. Create a launch project with milestones matching the timeline
2. Break each milestone into tasks with owners and due dates
3. Create a launch day checklist as a separate task list
4. Set up daily standup meetings for the 2 weeks before launch

### Email (Mailchimp/HubSpot/ConvertKit)
1. Build pre-launch teaser sequence (3-5 emails)
2. Create launch day announcement email
3. Design post-launch follow-up sequence
4. Segment audience for personalized messaging

### Social Media (Buffer/Hootsuite/Native)
1. Schedule pre-launch countdown posts
2. Prepare launch day content (10+ posts across platforms)
3. Create a social monitoring dashboard for launch mentions
4. Brief team on real-time response protocol

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Low launch-day traffic | Insufficient pre-launch marketing | Extend launch window; increase paid promotion post-launch |
| Media didn't cover it | Weak pitch or bad timing | Follow up with exclusive angles; pivot to community-driven buzz |
| High signups but low activation | Product-market misalignment or bad onboarding | Focus on activation experiments; gather user feedback immediately |
| Launch overshadowed by competitor | Bad timing | Double down on differentiation messaging; consider a "response" campaign |

## How to Get Your Data

- **No data needed**: Describe your product, audience, and timeline — Claude builds the full GTM plan
- **Market research**: Share any customer interviews, survey results, or competitive analysis
- **Past launches**: Describe what worked and what didn't

## Example

**Input**: "GTM plan for launching an AI-powered email assistant. Target: SMB sales teams. Launch date: April 15. Budget: $15,000. Have a waitlist of 2,000 emails and beta group of 50 users."

**Output**: Phased launch strategy: Beta expansion (April 1-14) → Public launch (April 15) → Sustained campaign (April 16-May 15). Positioning: "Write personalized follow-ups in 10 seconds — not 10 minutes." Pre-launch: waitlist email sequence (5 emails over 2 weeks, featuring beta testimonials), social teaser campaign (LinkedIn focus, 3 posts/week), press outreach to 20 SaaS/sales publications with early access offer. Launch day playbook: 6 AM — publish blog + Product Hunt launch; 8 AM — send waitlist email; 9 AM — LinkedIn post (CEO personal account); 10 AM — paid social activation ($2K daily for launch week). Post-launch: case study from beta users (week 2), comparison content vs. alternatives (week 3), webinar "How AI is Changing Sales Outreach" (week 4). Budget: $5K pre-launch (content + PR), $7K launch week (paid), $3K post-launch (content + retargeting). Targets: 500 signups day 1, 2,000 signups month 1, 200 activated users month 1.
