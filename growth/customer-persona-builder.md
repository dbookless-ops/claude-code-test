### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No customer data?** Interview 5 recent customers. Even informal conversations yield enough for a starter persona.
- **No analytics?** Describe your top 3 customers from memory: their role, company size, pain points, and how they found you.
- **No survey results?** Send a 3-question survey to your last 20 customers: biggest challenge, why they chose you, what they'd improve.
- **No market research?** Use publicly available reports, Reddit threads, and review sites to understand your audience.

## Process

1. **Data Collection & Normalization**
   - Accept survey CSV, interview notes, or analytics data
   - If interview notes: Extract structured data (age, role, pain points, goals)
   - If analytics: Aggregate into demographic + behavior segments
   - Validate completeness
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Confirm data represents real customer base

2. **Segmentation & Clustering**
   - Group respondents by primary job title/function
   - Secondary grouping: Company size or industry if applicable
   - Identify 2-4 distinct persona clusters
   - Note overlap and unique traits per segment
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Approve persona count and segmentation logic

3. **Demographic Synthesis**
   - Summarize age range, job title, company size for each persona
   - Extract industry/vertical focus
   - Identify seniority level and decision-making authority
   - Calculate average metrics (years in role, budget authority)
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Validate demographics feel representative

4. **Psychographic & Behavioral Extraction**
   - Identify core values and priorities
   - Extract primary pain points (top 3-5 per persona)
   - Map goals and success metrics
   - Determine preferred communication channels
   - Extract language patterns and personality traits
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Review psychographic summaries

5. **Buying Journey Mapping**
   - Identify awareness stage behaviors (how they discover solutions)
   - Map consideration stage (evaluation criteria, research sources)
   - Pinpoint decision stage (objections, final concerns)
   - Timeline from awareness to purchase decision
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Approve buying journey flow

6. **Messaging & Content Strategy**
   - Extract resonant language and phrases from source data
   - Identify objection themes and rebuttals
   - Define value propositions per persona
   - Recommend content types and channels
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Review messaging angles

7. **Output & Template Generation**
   - Create markdown persona documents
   - Generate persona comparison matrix
   - Produce implementation guide for marketing use


> **Benchmark Context**: Good Day 1 retention is 20-30% for mobile apps and 40%+ for strong SaaS products (Amplitude/Mixpanel 2025 Benchmarks). Median net revenue retention for SaaS is ~110% (Bessemer Venture Partners 2025).


### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

4. Create a pivot table for summary views
5. Share with growth team for alignment

### Notion / Confluence
1. Create a new page for the analysis
2. Paste the Markdown output directly (both support Markdown)

4. Create linked databases for tracking actions

### Miro / FigJam (Visual Workshop)
1. Create a new board
2. Add persona cards or journey maps as sticky notes
3. Use the output data points as labels
4. Collaborate with team to prioritize actions

## Failure Modes

| Scenario | Symptom | Resolution |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Insufficient data | <3 respondents or interviews | Flag warning; ask for more data; note assumptions made |
| Contradictory data | Persona A says "budget $5k", Persona B says "$50k" (both Marketing Manager) | Note as separate personas; don't average across roles |
| Generic survey | No differentiation between personas | Ask follow-up questions; recommend segmentation variable |
| Interview bias | All respondents from customer reference list (happy customers) | Note bias; recommend including churned/non-converted prospects |
| Missing pain points | Survey lacks pain point questions | Infer from goals (inverse of goal = problem area) and note assumption |
| Unclear job titles | "Manager" (of what?) | Ask for context; extract from company description or role details |
