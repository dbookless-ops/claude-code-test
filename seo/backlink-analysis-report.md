# Backlink Analysis Report

Analyzes backlink profiles to assess authority, identify toxic links, discover competitor link gaps, and build an actionable link acquisition strategy.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementation in Google Search Console / CMS. If implementing outreach, add 5-20 hours for link building campaigns. Input is backlink export from Ahrefs, Moz, or Semrush. Output is Markdown analysis with link building action plan.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Analyze our backlink profile" (audit)
- "Find link building opportunities" (prospecting)
- "Which backlinks are hurting our SEO?" (toxic links)
- "Competitor backlink gap analysis" (competitive)
- "How do we increase domain authority?" (strategy)
- "Create a disavow file" (cleanup)
- "Anchor text distribution looks unnatural" (anchor audit)
- "Our link profile vs. competitor" (comparison)
- "Digital PR for link building" (PR-led links)
- "Reclaim lost backlinks" (reclamation)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Backlink Export | CSV | Ahrefs, Moz, or Semrush backlink export |
| Domain | Text | Your website domain |
| Goal | Text | Authority building, toxic cleanup, competitive gap, or specific ranking target |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No backlink tool?** Use free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools or Google Search Console Links report (limited but usable). Claude can work with GSC data.
- **No competitor data?** Tell Claude your top 3 competitors. Strategy will be based on best practices rather than gap analysis.
- **No link building experience?** Claude generates a beginner-friendly outreach plan with email templates and target criteria.
- **Small site with few backlinks?** That's a starting point, not a problem. Claude focuses on foundational link building tactics.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Competitor Backlinks | CSV | Top 3 competitor backlink exports |
| Target Keywords | Text list | Keywords you're trying to rank for |
| Current DA/DR | Number | Domain Authority or Domain Rating |
| Industry | Text | For industry-specific link opportunities |
| Past Outreach | Text | Previous link building efforts and results |

## Process

### Step 1: Profile Health Assessment
- Total referring domains and backlinks count
- Domain authority / domain rating trend
- Follow vs. nofollow ratio (healthy: 70-85% follow)
- Link velocity (new vs. lost links per month)
- Top linked pages analysis

### Step 2: Anchor Text Analysis
- Branded vs. exact-match vs. generic distribution
- Flag over-optimized anchor text (>5% exact match for competitive terms)
- Natural anchor text recommendations
- Identify potential manual penalty risks

### Step 3: Toxic Link Identification
- Spam score assessment per linking domain
- PBN (Private Blog Network) detection signals
- Link scheme patterns (paid links, excessive reciprocal linking)
- Foreign language spam links
- Disavow file generation for confirmed toxic links

### Step 4: Competitor Gap Analysis
- Identify domains linking to competitors but not to you
- Classify gap links by type (editorial, directory, resource, guest post)
- Prioritize by domain authority and relevance
- Estimate acquisition difficulty per opportunity

### Step 5: Link Building Strategy
- Content-led link building (linkable assets, data studies, tools)
- Digital PR opportunities (newsjacking, expert commentary, data stories)
- Resource page link building
- Broken link building opportunities
- Guest posting targets (quality over quantity)
- HARO / Connectively / journalist queries
- Unlinked brand mention reclamation

### Step 6: Outreach Plan
- Target list with contact information needs
- Email templates for each link type
- Follow-up cadence (3-touch sequence)
- Success metrics and tracking

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Backlink data varies between tools — Ahrefs and Semrush discover different links. For complete analysis, cross-reference two tools. Toxic link scoring is probabilistic, not definitive — disavow only clearly spammy links. Domain authority is a third-party metric, not a Google ranking factor, but correlates with ranking ability.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review disavow file carefully before submitting to Google — incorrectly disavowing good links can hurt rankings. Verify outreach targets are legitimate sites before contacting. Never pay for links from link farms or PBNs.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Backlinko 2024 SEO Statistics for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Ahrefs
1. Site Explorer → enter domain → Backlinks report → Export
2. Competing Domains → identify top competitors
3. Link Intersect → find gap opportunities
4. Content Explorer → find linkable content ideas in your niche

### Google Search Console
1. Links report → Export top linking sites and top linked pages
2. Cross-reference with manual review for spam links
3. Submit disavow file via Disavow Links tool

### Outreach Tools
1. Use Hunter.io or Apollo for finding contact emails
2. Track outreach in a CRM or spreadsheet (Pitchbox, BuzzStream, or Google Sheets)
3. Set up email sequences with 3-touch follow-up cadence
4. Track link placements and anchor text monthly

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Disavow hurt rankings | Disavowed legitimate links | Remove entries from disavow file; resubmit |
| Outreach gets no responses | Generic templates or wrong targets | Personalize first line; verify contact accuracy; improve subject lines |
| Links don't improve rankings | Links from irrelevant or low-authority sites | Focus on topical relevance over raw DA; build links to specific pages |
| Penalized for link scheme | Paid links or PBN detected | Disavow offending links; file reconsideration request if manual action |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Ahrefs**: Site Explorer → [domain] → Backlinks → Export
- **Semrush**: Backlink Analytics → [domain] → Export
- **Moz**: Link Explorer → [domain] → Export
- **Free option**: Google Search Console → Links → Export External Links
- **No tools**: Provide your domain and competitors — Claude designs a strategy based on best practices

## Example

**Input**: "Backlink analysis for a B2B SaaS blog. DR 35, 450 referring domains. Competitors have DR 55-65. Losing rankings to competitors on key terms. Ahrefs export attached."

**Output**: Profile health: 450 RDs is below competitor average (1,200). Anchor text: 22% exact-match anchors (too high, risk of penalty — target <5%). Toxic links: 35 domains flagged (15 confirmed spam, 20 low-quality directories) — disavow file generated. Competitor gap: 280 domains link to 2+ competitors but not to you — top 50 prioritized by DA and relevance. Strategy: (1) Create 2 original data studies per quarter (most linkable asset type in B2B), (2) HARO responses — target 5 journalist queries/week, expect 2-3 links/month, (3) Guest posting on 10 industry blogs (pre-vetted list with DA 40+), (4) Reclaim 12 unlinked brand mentions found via Ahrefs Content Explorer. 90-day plan: Month 1 — disavow toxic links + launch first data study; Month 2 — begin outreach to gap domains + HARO cadence; Month 3 — guest post submissions + second data study. Target: 25-35 new quality referring domains in 90 days.
