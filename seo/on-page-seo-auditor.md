# On-Page SEO Auditor

Audit a single webpage's on-page SEO elements across 8 dimensions. Produces a scored report card with specific fixes and rewritten elements.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementation in Google Search Console / CMS.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is page HTML or content. Output is a scored audit with rewrites. One page per session — for site-wide audits, run multiple times or use technical-seo-crawler-parser.

## User Intent Mapping

Trigger when the user says:

- "Audit this page for SEO" (direct request)
- "Why isn't this page ranking for [keyword]?" (diagnostic)
- "Check my title tags and meta descriptions" (specific element)
- "Is my heading structure correct for SEO?" (structure question)
- "Review my page's keyword usage" (optimization check)
- "What SEO improvements can I make to this page?" (improvement request)
- "I pasted the HTML, check it for SEO" (HTML input)
- "Optimize this page for [keyword]" (optimization task)
- "Score my page's on-page SEO" (scoring request)
- "Check if my images have proper alt text" (element-specific)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

Provide ONE of the following:

| Input Type | Description |
|---|---|
| HTML source | Full or partial HTML of the page |
| Page content | Copy-pasted text content with headings |
| URL + manual content | User describes page content (Claude cannot crawl) |

Plus:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target_keyword` | Yes | Primary keyword the page should rank for |
| `secondary_keywords` | No | 2-5 related keywords |
| `page_type` | No | Blog post / Landing page / Product page / Homepage |

### Sample Input

```
Target keyword: project management software
Secondary keywords: best PM tools, project management app, team collaboration software
Page type: Landing page

[User pastes HTML or content of the page]
```

### Input Validation Rules

1. Target keyword is required — prompt if missing
2. Content must be substantial (>200 words) for meaningful analysis
3. If HTML is provided, parse it for structured elements; if plain text, work with what's available
4. Flag if page appears to be a duplicate of another provided page

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No Search Console access?** Ask your web developer to grant you Viewer access, or use free tools like Ubersuggest for basic keyword data.
- **No keyword research?** Type your topic into Google and note the autocomplete suggestions + "People Also Ask" questions. That's free keyword research.
- **No competitor URLs?** Search your target keyword — the top 5 organic results are your SEO competitors.
- **No content inventory?** Export your sitemap (yoursite.com/sitemap.xml) or use Screaming Frog's free tier (500 URLs).

## Process

1. **Parse page elements** — Extract: title tag, meta description, H1, H2-H6 hierarchy, body content, image alt tags, internal/external links, word count, URL structure.

2. **Audit 8 dimensions** — Score each 1-10:

   **a. Title Tag (weight: 15%)**
   - Contains target keyword? Position of keyword (front-loaded is better)?
   - Length: 50-60 characters optimal. Flag if too short/long.
   - Compelling for clicks? Unique value proposition?

   **b. Meta Description (weight: 10%)**
   - Contains target keyword? Length: 150-160 characters?
   - Includes call-to-action? Differentiating?

   **c. Heading Structure (weight: 15%)**
   - Single H1 containing target keyword?
   - Logical H2-H6 hierarchy (no skipped levels)?
   - Keywords naturally distributed across H2s?

   **d. Content Quality & Keyword Usage (weight: 20%)**
   - Word count adequate for topic? (compare to typical top-ranking content)
   - Keyword density: 1-2% for primary, 0.5-1% for secondary
   - Natural usage — no keyword stuffing
   - Semantic variations and related terms present?

   **e. Internal Linking (weight: 10%)**
   - Number of internal links (aim for 3-5 per 1,000 words)
   - Descriptive anchor text? Relevant destinations?
   - Links to/from pillar content?

   **f. Image Optimization (weight: 10%)**
   - All images have alt text? Alt text includes keywords where natural?
   - File names descriptive (not IMG_001.jpg)?

   **g. URL Structure (weight: 10%)**
   - Short, descriptive, contains keyword?
   - No unnecessary parameters or deep nesting?

   **h. Schema Markup (weight: 10%)**
   - Appropriate schema type for page? (Article, Product, FAQ, HowTo)
   - Required schema fields present?

3. **Calculate overall score** — Weighted average across 8 dimensions (1-100 scale).

4. **Generate fixes** — For each issue, provide:
   - What's wrong (current state)
   - Why it matters (SEO impact)
   - Rewritten/fixed version (ready to copy-paste)

5. **Human checkpoint** — Present score summary. Ask: "Want me to rewrite your title tag, meta description, and H1 with the fixes applied?"

6. **Generate output** — Markdown audit report with scores and fixes.


> **Benchmark Context**: Average time to rank on page 1 for a new page is 6-12 months, with only 1.74% of new pages reaching the top 10 within a year (Ahrefs 2025 Study). The #1 organic result gets ~27.6% of clicks (First Page Sage 2025 Google CTR Report).


### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Output Contract

### Output Format

| Output | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| SEO audit report | Markdown | Scored audit with fixes per dimension |
| Quick fixes | Markdown | Top 5 copy-paste-ready fixes |

### Audit Report Structure

```markdown

## Score Card
| Dimension | Score | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Title Tag | 7/10 | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| Meta Description | 4/10 | ❌ Critical |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Detailed Findings

### Title Tag — 7/10
**Current:** [current title]
**Issues:** Keyword not front-loaded. 72 characters (too long).
**Recommended:** [rewritten title, 58 chars]
**Impact:** Medium — better keyword position improves relevance signal.

[Repeat for each dimension]

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Google Search Console
1. Navigate to Performance → Search Results
2. Compare output keywords against actual impressions/clicks
3. Use the URL Inspection tool to verify indexing
4. Submit updated pages for re-crawling after changes

### WordPress + Yoast/RankMath
1. Edit the target page in WordPress
2. Paste optimized title tag and meta description in the SEO plugin fields
3. Add recommended headings and content structure
4. Check the SEO score indicator before publishing

### Google Sheets (Tracking)
1. Create a keyword tracking spreadsheet from the output
2. Add columns: current rank, target rank, monthly search volume
3. Update rankings weekly using Search Console data
4. Track progress over 3-6 month periods

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| No HTML provided | User only described the page | Work with available info; note that HTML analysis would be more thorough |
| No target keyword | User forgot to specify | Ask: "What keyword should this page rank for?" |
| Very thin content (<200 words) | Thin page | Flag as critical issue; recommend minimum word count |
| Non-English content | Different language | Adjust character limits for title/meta; note analysis may be less precise |
| JavaScript-rendered content | SPA/React page | Note that search engines may see different content; recommend checking rendered HTML |
| Page is a PDF or non-HTML | Wrong format | Explain this skill works with HTML pages; suggest manual review |

## How to Get Your Data

### View Page Source (Any Browser)

1. Navigate to your page
2. Right-click → "View Page Source" (or Ctrl+U / Cmd+U)
