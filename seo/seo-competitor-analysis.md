# SEO Competitor Analysis

Comprehensive competitor SEO analysis — keyword overlap, content gaps, backlink comparison, SERP positioning, and actionable strategies to outrank competitors.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementation in Google Search Console / CMS. If implementing strategy, add 4-10 hours for content and link building. Input is SEO tool exports for you and competitors. Output is Markdown competitive analysis with attack plan.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Who's outranking us and why?" (diagnosis)
- "SEO competitor analysis for our market" (landscape)
- "Which keywords do competitors rank for that we don't?" (gaps)
- "Compare our SEO to competitor X" (head-to-head)
- "SEO share of voice analysis" (market share)
- "Competitor content strategy analysis" (content)
- "Why does competitor X rank higher?" (specific diagnosis)
- "SEO opportunities competitors are missing" (opportunities)
- "Competitor backlink comparison" (links)
- "SEO market positioning" (strategy)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Your Domain | Text | Your website domain |
| Competitor Domains | Text list | 3-5 competitor domains |
| Target Keywords | Text list | Core keywords for your business |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **Don't know your competitors?** Tell Claude your industry and product. Google your top 5 keywords — the sites that consistently appear are your SEO competitors (not always your business competitors).
- **No SEO tool?** Use free versions: Ubersuggest (3 free searches/day), Google Search Console (your data), or Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (your backlinks). Claude can work with manual SERP observations.
- **No keyword data?** Claude identifies competitor keywords from their content and site structure analysis.
- **No backlink data?** Claude focuses on content and keyword strategy. Add backlink analysis when you get tool access.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Keyword Rankings | CSV | Your rankings vs. competitor rankings |
| Organic Traffic Estimates | Text | Ahrefs/Semrush traffic estimates per competitor |
| Competitor Content | Text | Notable content pieces or strategies |
| Backlink Data | CSV | Referring domains comparison |
| Business Context | Text | How you differentiate from competitors |

## Process

### Step 1: Competitive Landscape Mapping
- Identify true SEO competitors (may differ from business competitors)
- Organic traffic comparison (estimated monthly organic visits)
- Domain authority / domain rating comparison
- Total keyword portfolio size per competitor
- Organic traffic trend (growing, stable, declining)

### Step 2: Keyword Gap Analysis
- Keywords competitors rank for that you don't (opportunity gap)
- Keywords where competitors outrank you (competitive gap)
- Shared keywords with different rankings (improvement gap)
- Long-tail keywords competitors haven't targeted (white space)

### Step 3: Content Strategy Analysis
- Content types that rank (blog, product pages, tools, guides)
- Content depth and format comparison
- Publishing frequency and content freshness
- Top-performing content by traffic and backlinks
- Content cluster / topic authority assessment

### Step 4: Backlink Comparison
- Referring domains count and quality comparison
- Link acquisition velocity per competitor
- Common linking domains (who links to everyone)
- Unique linking domains (competitive advantages)
- Link building tactics competitors use

### Step 5: SERP Positioning Analysis
- SERP feature ownership per competitor (snippets, PAA, rich results)
- Brand SERP comparison
- Local vs. national ranking differences
- Mobile vs. desktop ranking variations

### Step 6: Attack Strategy
- Quick wins: keywords where small improvements yield big results
- Content opportunities: topics competitors haven't covered well
- Link targets: sites linking to competitors but not you
- Technical advantages: speed, UX, schema opportunities
- Differentiation: content angles competitors can't replicate

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Third-party traffic estimates (Ahrefs, Semrush) can be 30-50% off from actual traffic — use for relative comparison, not absolute numbers. Keyword difficulty scores vary between tools. Competitor strategies should inform, not dictate, your approach — copying competitors leads to parity, not advantage.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Verify competitor identification with the business team — SEO competitors may not be business competitors. Review attack strategy for feasibility given your resources (team size, content budget, link building capacity).

> **Benchmark Context**: See BrightEdge 2024 Organic Search Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Semrush
1. Domain Overview → enter each competitor → compare organic metrics
2. Keyword Gap → enter your domain + competitors → find missing keywords
3. Organic Research → Competitors tab → discover new SEO competitors
4. Backlink Gap → compare referring domain profiles

### Ahrefs
1. Site Explorer → Competing Domains → identify keyword overlap
2. Content Gap → find keywords competitors rank for that you don't
3. Top Pages → see which competitor pages drive the most traffic
4. Link Intersect → find sites linking to competitors but not you

### Google Search Console
1. Performance → compare your rankings to manual competitor checks
2. Coverage → ensure your pages are indexed and competitive
3. Identify keywords where you're position 4-10 (easy improvement targets)

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Chasing wrong competitors | SEO competitors ≠ business competitors | Re-identify based on actual SERP overlap |
| Copying competitor content | Leads to parity, not advantage | Differentiate with unique data, angles, or format |
| Overwhelmed by gap size | Too many keyword gaps to address | Prioritize by volume × achievability; focus on clusters |
| Analysis paralysis | Too much data, no action | Pick top 10 keywords, execute for 90 days, then reassess |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Semrush**: Keyword Gap tool + Organic Research for each competitor
- **Ahrefs**: Content Gap + Competing Domains + Top Pages
- **Free**: Search your keywords manually and note who ranks; use Google Search Console for your own data
- **No tools**: List your domain and competitors — Claude analyzes based on available data

## Example

**Input**: "SEO competitor analysis: we're an HR software company (domain: hrflow.io). Competitors: bamboohr.com, gusto.com, rippling.com. We rank for 200 keywords, competitors rank for 5,000+. Struggling to compete."

**Output**: Landscape: BambooHR (DR 78, 850K organic/month, 45K keywords), Gusto (DR 82, 1.2M organic/month, 58K keywords), Rippling (DR 75, 420K organic/month, 22K keywords). Your position: DR 35, 8K organic/month, 200 keywords — significant gap but winnable with focused strategy. Keyword gap: 1,200 keywords where all 3 competitors rank but you don't — filtered to 85 achievable targets (KD <40, volume >200). Top opportunities: "employee onboarding checklist" (8,100/mo, no strong content from competitors), "PTO policy template" (4,400/mo, competitors have thin content), "HR compliance checklist" (3,200/mo, template-based content gap). Content strategy: competitors dominate with template/checklist content (40% of their traffic) — create 20 best-in-class templates in 90 days. Link strategy: 45 domains link to 2+ competitors but not you — 15 are high-quality industry publications achievable via expert commentary. Attack plan: Month 1 — publish 8 template pages targeting highest-volume gaps; Month 2 — begin outreach to gap link targets; Month 3 — launch "State of HR" data report for link-worthy content. Quick win: optimize existing 200 keyword pages (title tags, content depth) — expected 30% traffic lift from position improvements.
