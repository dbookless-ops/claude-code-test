# Segmentation Rule Builder

Designs CRM segmentation rules and dynamic lists for targeted marketing campaigns, sales prioritization, and personalized customer experiences.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min configuring in Salesforce / HubSpot. If implementing, add 2-4 hours for CRM configuration. Input is CRM data fields and marketing goals. Output is Markdown segmentation architecture with rule definitions and implementation steps.

## User Intent Mapping

- "How to segment our CRM contacts" (strategy)
- "Build dynamic lists in HubSpot/Salesforce" (implementation)
- "Segmentation rules for email campaigns" (email)
- "RFM segmentation for our customers" (RFM)
- "Our CRM has 50K contacts — how to organize?" (organization)
- "Behavioral segmentation rules" (behavioral)
- "Segment by engagement level" (engagement)
- "Suppression list strategy" (suppression)
- "List hygiene rules" (hygiene)
- "Segment overlap — contacts in too many lists" (overlap)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CRM Platform | Text | HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, etc. |
| Contact Volume | Text | Total contacts in CRM |
| Marketing Goals | Text | What you want segmentation to enable |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **Don't know what fields to segment by?** Claude audits your CRM's available fields and recommends the highest-impact segmentation dimensions.
- **Messy CRM data?** Claude designs a data cleanup strategy alongside segmentation — clean data first, segment second.
- **No behavioral data?** Claude starts with demographic/firmographic segmentation and recommends behavioral tracking setup.
- **Not sure how granular to go?** Claude recommends segment sizes (minimum 500 contacts per segment for email) and warns against over-segmentation.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CRM Fields | Text | Available data fields for segmentation |
| Current Segments | Text | Existing lists or segments |
| Email Performance | CSV | Open/click rates by segment |
| Customer Data | CSV | Purchase history, engagement data |
| Compliance | Text | Opt-in requirements (GDPR, CAN-SPAM) |

## Process

### Step 1: Segmentation Dimension Hierarchy
| Dimension | Data Source | Example Segments |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle stage | CRM field | Subscriber, MQL, SQL, Customer, Churned |
| Engagement level | Behavioral tracking | Active (30 days), Warm (90 days), Cold (90+ days), Dead |
| Industry/Vertical | CRM field | SaaS, E-commerce, Healthcare, Finance |
| Company size | CRM field | SMB (<50), Mid-market (50-500), Enterprise (500+) |
| Product interest | Behavioral/form | Product A, Product B, Multiple |
| Geography | CRM field | Americas, EMEA, APAC |
| Purchase history | Transaction data | New, Repeat, High-value, At-risk |
| Content topic | Engagement data | Topic A readers, Topic B readers |

### Step 2: Engagement Scoring Rules
| Level | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Highly engaged | 5+ email opens AND 2+ clicks in 30 days | Priority nurture, sales alert |
| Engaged | 2+ email opens OR 1+ click in 30 days | Regular nurture cadence |
| Warm | 1+ email open in 90 days, no clicks | Re-engagement campaign |
| Cold | No opens in 90 days | Sunset warning sequence |
| Dead | No opens in 180 days, no website visits | Suppress from sends or remove |

### Step 3: Dynamic List Architecture
| List Type | Purpose | Rules | Update |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active list | Contacts meeting criteria right now | Dynamic (auto-updates) | Real-time |
| Static list | Point-in-time snapshot (event attendees) | Manual or import | One-time |
| Suppression list | Contacts to exclude from sends | Dynamic | Real-time |
| Enrollment list | Campaign-specific targeting | Dynamic with date logic | Campaign-based |

### Step 4: Suppression Rules
Always suppress:
- Unsubscribed contacts (legal requirement)
- Hard bounced emails (deliverability)
- Competitors and internal employees (data quality)
- Contacts who purchased in last 7 days (experience)
- Contacts currently in a sales conversation (alignment)
- Contacts who received 3+ emails this week (fatigue)

### Step 5: Segment Overlap Management
- Primary segment assignment: each contact has ONE primary segment
- Multi-segment eligibility: contacts can qualify for multiple campaigns
- Priority rules: if contact qualifies for 2 campaigns, which takes priority?
- Frequency caps: maximum emails per contact per week (typically 2-3)
- Exclusion rules: don't email about Product A if they already own Product A

### Step 6: Segment Health Monitoring
| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Segment growth rate | Positive month-over-month | Flat or declining | Review acquisition for that segment |
| Segment engagement | >20% open rate | <10% open rate | Review content relevance or sunset |
| Segment size | 500+ contacts | <100 contacts | Merge with similar segment or broaden criteria |
| Overlap rate | <20% with other segments | >50% overlap | Refine criteria to reduce overlap |

### Confidence & Sample Size

> **Confidence Note**: Segments smaller than 500 contacts produce unreliable email performance data — you can't tell if 30% open rate is meaningful or noise. Aim for 500-5,000 contacts per segment for reliable A/B testing. Over-segmentation is as dangerous as no segmentation — 20 tiny segments mean 20 separate campaigns to manage. Start with 5-8 core segments and add granularity only when data shows it improves performance. Behavioral segmentation outperforms demographic segmentation for email targeting — what people do matters more than who they are.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review all segmentation rules for GDPR/CAN-SPAM compliance before activating. Verify suppression lists are working correctly (test with known contacts). Check segment overlap to ensure contacts aren't receiving duplicate communications.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Salesforce 2024 State of Marketing for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### HubSpot
1. Create active lists for each segment (Contacts → Lists → Create List)
2. Use AND/OR logic for multi-criteria segments
3. Set up engagement tracking properties (last email open, last website visit)
4. Create suppression lists for each campaign type
5. Build reporting dashboard by segment performance

### Salesforce
1. Create Report filters matching segment criteria
2. Build Campaign Member segments for email targeting
3. Use Pardot/Marketing Cloud dynamic lists for behavioral segments
4. Configure Einstein Engagement Scoring for engagement-based segments
5. Set up scheduled reports for segment health monitoring

### General CRM/ESP
1. Map available data fields to segmentation dimensions
2. Create core segments (5-8) based on highest-impact dimensions
3. Set up behavioral tracking for engagement-based segmentation
4. Configure suppression rules and frequency caps
5. Schedule monthly segment health review

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Over-segmentation | Too many tiny segments, can't maintain | Merge segments under 500 contacts; simplify to core dimensions |
| Stale segments | Rules not updated as business changes | Quarterly segment review; dynamic lists over static |
| Missing contacts | Segmentation rules have gaps (no default) | Add "catch-all" segment for uncategorized contacts |
| Deliverability drops | Sending to unengaged segments | Implement engagement-based suppression; sunset cold contacts |

## How to Get Your Data

- **CRM fields**: CRM → Settings → Properties/Fields → export available fields
- **Contact volume**: CRM → Contacts → total count and breakdown by key fields
- **Email metrics**: ESP → Campaign reports → aggregate by segment or list
- **No segmentation yet**: Share your CRM platform and contact volume — Claude designs starter segments

## Example

**Input**: "Segmentation rules for HubSpot CRM. 35K contacts. Mix of leads and customers. Send weekly newsletter and monthly product updates. No current segmentation — same email goes to everyone. B2B SaaS with 3 products."

**Output**: Problem: 35K contacts receiving the same email = low engagement, high unsubscribe risk, wasted sends. Core segments (7): (1) Active Customers — purchased in last 12 months (engagement, retention). (2) New Leads — created in last 30 days, not yet customers (nurture). (3) Engaged Prospects — 2+ email opens in 30 days, not customers (sales-ready). (4) Product A Interest — engaged with Product A content (targeted promotion). (5) Product B Interest — engaged with Product B content. (6) Product C Interest — engaged with Product C content. (7) Cold/Unengaged — no email opens in 90+ days (sunset sequence). Suppression lists: unsubscribed, hard bounced, competitors (identified by domain), internal team. Implementation: Phase 1 (week 1) — create engagement-based segments (active/engaged/cold). Phase 2 (week 2) — create product interest segments from content engagement data. Phase 3 (week 3) — segment newsletter by engagement level, product updates by product interest. Expected results: open rates increase from typical 18% unsegmented to 25-35% segmented. Unsubscribe rate drops 40-50%. Newsletter engagement increases 2x.
