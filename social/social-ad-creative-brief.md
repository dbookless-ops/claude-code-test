# Social Ad Creative Brief

Creates detailed creative briefs for paid social ads with visual concepts, copy direction, format specifications, and A/B test plans. Covers Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and YouTube ad formats.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~20-40 min scheduling in Buffer / Hootsuite / native platform. If implementing output in a platform, add 20-30 min for design handoff. Input is product info and campaign objective. Output is Markdown creative brief with 3+ concept directions.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Create an ad creative brief for Facebook ads" (platform-specific)
- "I need TikTok ad concepts for our app" (platform-specific)
- "What should our Instagram ad look like?" (visual direction)
- "Ad creative ideas for a product launch" (campaign)
- "Brief our designer on social ad creatives" (handoff)
- "UGC-style ad concepts for Meta" (format-specific)
- "Video ad script for TikTok" (video ads)
- "A/B test plan for ad creatives" (testing)
- "Static vs. video — what ad format works better?" (format decision)
- "Creative refresh — our ad fatigue is high" (optimization)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Product/Service | Text | What you're advertising and key value proposition |
| Campaign Objective | Text | awareness, traffic, conversions, app installs, leads |
| Platform(s) | Text | Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, or all |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No creative assets?** This skill generates the concept brief — your designer executes it. Or use Canva templates.
- **No brand guidelines?** Share your website URL and 3 adjectives describing your brand aesthetic.
- **No past ad data?** Claude uses platform benchmarks. After running, compare results.
- **No budget info?** The brief works regardless of budget — focus on the creative.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Target Audience | Text | Demographics, interests, pain points |
| Budget | Text | Daily or campaign budget (affects format recommendations) |
| Brand Guidelines | Text | Colors, fonts, tone, logo rules |
| Past Top Performers | Text | Describe or link previous successful ads |
| Competitor Ads | Text | Examples of competitor creative |

## Process

### Step 1: Format Selection
Match ad format to objective and platform:

| Objective | Best Formats | Platform Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | Video (6-15s), Carousel | TikTok: 9:16 video. Meta: Reels + Feed |
| Traffic | Single image, Carousel | LinkedIn: Single image. Meta: Link ads |
| Conversions | UGC-style video, Before/After | Meta: Dynamic. TikTok: Spark Ads |
| App Installs | Demo video, Screenshots | TikTok: Playable. Meta: App Install format |
| Leads | Lead form + Video | LinkedIn: Lead Gen Forms. Meta: Instant Forms |

### Step 2: Concept Development (3 Directions)
For each concept, define:
- **Visual direction**: What the viewer sees (composition, style, mood)
- **Copy direction**: Headline, body, CTA text
- **Hook** (first 3 seconds for video): What stops the scroll
- **Format specs**: Dimensions, duration, file type
- **Talent/asset needs**: UGC creators, product shots, graphics

### Step 3: Platform Specs
| Platform | Dimensions | Duration | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meta Feed | 1080×1080 or 1080×1350 | 15-30s (video) | MP4, JPG, PNG |
| Meta Reels | 1080×1920 | 15-60s | MP4 |
| TikTok | 1080×1920 | 9-30s | MP4 |
| LinkedIn | 1200×627 | 15-30s (video) | MP4, JPG, PNG |
| Pinterest | 1000×1500 | 6-15s (video) | MP4, JPG, PNG |

### Step 4: A/B Test Plan
- Test 1: Creative concept A vs. B (visual style)
- Test 2: Hook variant 1 vs. 2 (first 3 seconds)
- Test 3: CTA text variant (action-focused vs. benefit-focused)
- Minimum budget per variant: $50-100/day for 5-7 days

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Creative performance is highly variable. Test minimum 3 concepts per campaign. A winning ad typically emerges after $200-$500 in test spend. Refresh creatives every 2-4 weeks to combat ad fatigue.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review concepts for brand safety, legal compliance (disclaimers, disclosures), and platform-specific ad policies before production.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Buffer 2024 State of Social for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Ad rejected by platform | Policy violation (claims, imagery) | Review platform ad policies; remove prohibited elements |
| Low CTR | Weak hook or irrelevant creative | Test new hooks; check audience targeting alignment |
| High CPC | Creative fatigue or broad targeting | Refresh creatives; narrow audience segments |
| Good clicks, no conversions | Ad-to-landing page mismatch | Align landing page messaging with ad copy |

## How to Get Your Data

- **No data needed**: Describe product, audience, and objective — Claude generates the brief
- **Meta Ad Library**: facebook.com/ads/library — search competitor ads for inspiration
- **TikTok Creative Center**: ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter — trending ad formats

## Example

**Input**: "Ad creative brief for a $49/mo meal planning app. Objective: app installs. Platforms: TikTok + Meta Reels. Target: busy parents 28-40."

**Output**: 3 concepts. Concept 1 ("Fridge Panic"): UGC-style video opening with someone staring at empty fridge, then showing app solving it in 30 seconds. Hook: "It's 5:30 PM and you have NO idea what's for dinner." Concept 2 ("Sunday Prep"): Before/after split screen — chaos vs. organized meal prep powered by app. Concept 3 ("Kid-Approved"): Testimonial-style with real parent showing kid eating a meal planned by app. A/B test: Concept 1 hook vs. Concept 2 hook, same CTA ("Try free for 7 days").
