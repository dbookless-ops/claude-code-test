# Instagram Caption Writer

Writes scroll-stopping Instagram captions with optimized hooks, storytelling structure, strategic hashtags, and clear CTAs. Supports feed posts, carousels, Reels, and Stories.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~20-40 min scheduling in Buffer / Hootsuite / native platform. If implementing output in a platform, add 5 min for posting. Input is post concept or image description. Output is 3+ caption variants with hashtag sets.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Write a caption for my product photo" (direct creation)
- "Instagram caption ideas for a fitness brand" (batch ideation)
- "Optimize my Instagram captions for engagement" (improvement)
- "Write carousel captions about skincare tips" (format-specific)
- "What hashtags should I use for [niche]?" (hashtag strategy)
- "Caption for a behind-the-scenes Reel" (Reel-specific)
- "Write 5 Instagram captions for this week" (batch creation)
- "My captions don't get engagement" (diagnosis)
- "Instagram caption for a product launch" (event-specific)
- "Turn this blog post into Instagram captions" (repurposing)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Post Concept | Text | What the post is about — product, topic, image description, or content idea |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No image yet?** Describe what you plan to photograph or design. Claude writes the caption, then you create the visual to match.
- **No brand voice?** Share 2-3 accounts whose tone you admire. Claude can match the style.
- **No hashtag research?** Claude generates hashtags based on your niche. Refine after seeing which ones drive discovery.
- **No analytics?** Post 3 variants over 2 weeks and compare reach/engagement to establish your baseline.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Brand Voice | Text | Tone descriptors: playful, minimal, educational, luxury, etc. |
| Format | Text | feed post, carousel, Reel, Story |
| Goal | Text | engagement, saves, shares, link clicks, DMs |
| Audience | Text | Target demographic and interests |
| CTA Type | Text | comment, save, share, DM, link in bio |

## Process

### Step 1: Hook Creation
First line determines 90% of whether someone reads the full caption:
- **Pattern interrupt**: "Stop scrolling if you [X]"
- **Bold statement**: "This changed everything about how I [X]"
- **Question**: "Want to know the secret to [X]?"
- **Stat/number**: "73% of [audience] get this wrong"
- **List tease**: "3 things nobody tells you about [X]"

### Step 2: Body Copy
- Match format to content type:
  - **Storytelling** (personal, behind-the-scenes): First person, emotional beats
  - **Educational** (tips, how-tos): Numbered steps, clear structure
  - **Promotional** (product, launch): Benefit-led, social proof, urgency
  - **Community** (questions, polls): Conversational, inclusive language
- Keep paragraphs to 1-2 sentences
- Use line breaks for readability
- Optimal length: 150-300 characters for engagement, up to 2,200 for SEO/saves

### Step 3: CTA Optimization
- Match CTA to goal:
  - **Engagement**: "Double tap if you agree" / "Tag someone who needs this"
  - **Saves**: "Save this for later" / "Bookmark this list"
  - **Shares**: "Share this with a friend who [X]"
  - **DMs**: "DM me [keyword] for the free guide"
  - **Link clicks**: "Link in bio for the full guide"

### Step 4: Hashtag Strategy
- Use 20-30 hashtags in first comment (not caption)
- Mix: 5 broad (500K+ posts), 10 medium (50K-500K), 10 niche (<50K)
- Include 1-2 branded hashtags
- Rotate hashtag sets to avoid shadowban risk

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Instagram engagement varies by niche, follower count, and posting time. Test 3+ variants per format before drawing conclusions. Algorithm changes frequently — what works today may shift quarterly.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review captions for authenticity and brand alignment. Add personal details or real experiences to avoid generic-sounding content.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Sprout Social 2024 Index, Hootsuite 2024 Social Trends Report, and Buffer 2024 State of Social for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.
## Output Contract

### Deliverable: Markdown with Caption Variants

```markdown
## Caption Variant A: [Style]
[Full caption with line breaks]

**CTA**: [call to action]
**Best for**: [feed/carousel/Reel]

## Caption Variant B: [Style]
[Full caption with line breaks]

## Hashtag Sets
### Set 1 (Broad + Niche Mix)
[20-30 hashtags]

### Set 2 (Alternate Rotation)
[20-30 hashtags]

## Posting Notes
- Best time: [day/time for your audience]
- Add hashtags in first comment, not caption
- Respond to comments in first 30 minutes
```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Instagram (Direct)
1. Open Instagram → Create new post/Reel
2. Paste caption text (preserve line breaks — use Notes app as intermediary)
3. Post, then immediately comment with hashtags
4. Engage with comments in the first 30 minutes

### Later / Planoly / Buffer
1. Create new post → Upload media
2. Paste caption in the caption field
3. Add hashtags in the "First Comment" field
4. Schedule for recommended time

### Content Calendar (Batch Planning)
1. Generate 5-10 captions at once
2. Log in Google Sheets: date, format, caption, hashtag set, goal
3. Schedule across the week
4. Review performance after 48 hours per post

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Caption feels salesy | Too much product push | Lead with value or story, mention product at the end only |
| Low engagement | Hook isn't strong enough | Test 3 different hooks for the same content |
| Hashtag shadowban | Using banned or repetitive hashtags | Rotate sets, check hashtags aren't banned, mix sizes |
| Wrong tone for audience | Mismatch between voice and followers | Survey audience or check what competitors' tone looks like |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Instagram Insights**: Profile → Professional Dashboard → Content → See All
- **No analytics**: Describe your niche and audience — Claude generates from scratch
- **Competitor research**: Screenshot 5 top-performing posts in your niche for reference

## Example

**Input**: "Product launch post for an organic skincare serum. Target: women 25-40 interested in clean beauty. Tone: warm, educational."

**Output**:

> **Variant A (Educational Hook)**
>
> Your skin barrier is everything.
>
> And most serums actually damage it.
>
> That's why we spent 14 months formulating our new Barrier Repair Serum with:
> ✨ Ceramides (restore what cleansers strip away)
> ✨ Niacinamide (calm inflammation in 48 hours)
> ✨ Squalane (hydrate without clogging pores)
>
> No fragrance. No essential oils. No BS.
>
> Just science-backed ingredients your skin actually needs.
>
> Save this for your next skincare restock 🧴
