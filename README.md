## 🎯 Just Tell Claude What You Need

You don't need to browse 156 skills. Just **describe your problem** and the [MarTech Skill Router](skills/router/SKILL.md) recommends the right skills, in the right order, with the data you'll need to prepare.

```
 You say:                                     Claude recommends:
 ────────                                     ──────────────────

 "My email open rates                    →    Step 1: email-subject-line-tester
  dropped 20% this quarter"                   Step 2: email-deliverability-auditor
                                              Step 3: email-list-segmentation
                                              + what data to export, time estimate

 "I need to launch a product             →    Step 1: customer-persona-builder
  in 6 weeks"                                 Step 2: gtm-launch-planner
                                              Step 3: campaign-brief-synthesizer
                                              Step 4: content-distribution-strategy

 "My boss wants a marketing              →    Step 1: dashboard-requirement-gatherer
  dashboard by Friday"                        Step 2: marketing-dashboard-builder

 "We're losing customers and             →    Step 1: churn-prediction-framework
  I don't know why"                           Step 2: retention-analysis-framework
                                              Step 3: customer-journey-mapper

 "I have 500 keywords and                →    Step 1: keyword-cluster-analyzer
  don't know what to do with them"            Step 2: content-gap-analyzer
                                              Step 3: content-brief-generator
```

**New here? Just say "help"** and the router will walk you through everything — what skills are available, how they work, and how to get started based on your situation.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────┐
│  Your Data       │      │  Claude + Skill   │      │  Actionable Output   │
│  (CSV export     │  →   │  (paste data +    │  →   │  (strategy, audit,   │
│  from any tool)  │      │  trigger skill)   │      │  copy, analysis)     │
└─────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘      └─────────────────────┘
```

1. **Export your data** from any marketing tool as CSV — each skill tells you exactly what to export and where to find it
2. **Tell Claude what you need** in plain language — each skill has 10+ trigger phrases so Claude knows what to do
3. **Get production-ready output** — scored analyses, prioritized recommendations, ready-to-implement strategies

Every skill includes honest time estimates, confidence levels, industry benchmarks with sources, and clear "what this can't do" disclaimers. No black boxes. [Read our design philosophy →](METHODOLOGY.md)

| [Brand Positioning](workflows/brand-positioning.md) | 4 | VoC research → whitespace → narrative → campaign angles |

Every skill includes a **Related Skills** section suggesting 2-4 natural next steps, so you always know what to chain next. Plus a quick-reference cheat sheet for 10 common chains across email, analytics, video, CRO, and more.
