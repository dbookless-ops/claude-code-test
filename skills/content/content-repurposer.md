  Turn long-form content into multiple derivative assets across channels. Use this skill whenever
  the user mentions content repurposing, content recycling, turning a blog post into social posts,
  repurpose a webinar, create social snippets from an article, turn a whitepaper into emails,
  "get more mileage from this content", content atomization, content derivatives, micro-content,
  "break this down into smaller pieces", or any request to transform one content piece into
  multiple formats. Also trigger when the user says "I wrote this blog post, now help me promote it"
  or "create social posts from this article" or "turn this into an email series".

# Content Repurposer

Take a single long-form content piece (blog post, whitepaper, webinar transcript, podcast notes) and generate derivative assets for multiple channels: social posts, email snippets, infographic scripts, video scripts, and quote cards.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementing in your CMS.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is one content piece. Output is a multi-format content pack. No external tools needed.

## User Intent Mapping

Trigger when the user says:

- "Turn this blog post into social media content" (direct transformation)
- "I need to get more out of this article" (maximize ROI)
- "Create LinkedIn posts from this whitepaper" (platform-specific)
- "Help me atomize this content" (content strategy term)
- "I recorded a webinar, now create promotional content" (post-event)
- "What formats can I repurpose this into?" (exploration)
- "Generate 10 social posts from this blog" (quantity request)
- "Create email teasers from this report" (channel-specific)
- "Break this down into quote cards and thread content" (format-specific)
- "I need a content distribution plan for this piece" (strategic)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source_content` | text | The original content (article, transcript, report) |
| `content_type` | string | Blog post / Whitepaper / Webinar transcript / Podcast notes / Case study |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No content strategy?** Describe your product and your top 3 customer pain points. That's enough to generate an outline.
- **No keyword research?** List 5 questions your customers frequently ask. These become your topics.
- **No brand voice guide?** Provide 2-3 examples of content you like the tone of. Claude can infer the voice from examples.
- **No performance data?** Start fresh. After publishing, track views, time-on-page, and conversions for 30 days.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brand_voice` | string | Professional | Tone: Professional / Casual / Authoritative / Conversational |
| `target_platforms` | list | All | LinkedIn / Twitter/X / Instagram / Facebook / Email / Thread |
| `audience` | string | General B2B | Target audience description |
| `key_cta` | string | Read the full article | Call-to-action for derivative content |
| `source_url` | string | null | Link back to original content |

### Input Validation Rules

1. Source content must be >300 words (too short = not enough to repurpose)
2. Content type helps tailor output formats (e.g., webinar → video clips, not infographic)
3. If no platforms specified, generate for all major platforms
4. Flag if content appears to be a draft (incomplete sentences, notes)

## Process

1. **Analyze source** — Identify: core thesis, 3-5 key takeaways, quotable statistics, controversial/interesting claims, frameworks/models, story hooks.

2. **Extract repurposable elements:**
   - **Data points** — Stats, percentages, comparisons → infographic/quote cards
   - **Key arguments** — Thesis + supporting points → LinkedIn posts, threads
   - **Stories/examples** — Anecdotes, case studies → narrative social posts
   - **Frameworks** — Step-by-step processes → carousel/thread content
   - **Quotes** — Expert quotes, bold claims → quote cards, tweet-style posts
   - **Questions** — Provocative questions → engagement posts, polls

3. **Generate per-platform derivatives:**

   **LinkedIn (3-5 posts):**
   - Hook + story + insight format (1,200-1,500 chars)
   - Include line breaks for readability
   - End with question or CTA

   **Twitter/X (5-8 posts):**
   - Single tweets (≤280 chars) with hooks
   - One thread (5-8 tweets) unpacking a key concept
   - Data point tweets with context

   **Instagram (2-3 captions):**
   - Carousel content (10-slide breakdown)
   - Story poll/question prompts
   - Caption with hashtag suggestions (20-30 relevant tags)

   **Email (2-3 snippets):**
   - Newsletter teaser (50-100 words)
   - Full email featuring key insight
   - Subject line options (5 variants)

   **Video/Audio scripts (1-2):**
   - 60-second short-form video script
   - 2-minute explainer script with visual cues

4. **Human checkpoint** — Present the element extraction summary. Ask: "These are the key elements I'll repurpose. Any angles to emphasize or avoid?"

5. **Generate output** — Complete content pack organized by platform.

### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Platform Implementation Steps

### WordPress
1. Log in to wp-admin → Posts → Add New
2. Paste the content outline into the editor
3. Use the Heading blocks (H2, H3) for structure
4. Add Featured Image and set Category/Tags before publishing

### Google Docs (Collaboration)
1. Create a new Google Doc
2. Paste the output and use Suggesting Mode for team review
3. Use Insert → Table of Contents for navigation
4. Share with stakeholders for feedback

### CMS-Agnostic
1. Copy Markdown output as-is into any CMS that supports Markdown
2. For HTML-based CMS platforms, convert Markdown to HTML using any converter
3. Adapt headings and formatting to match your site's style guide

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Content too short (<300 words) | Brief article | Extract what's there; suggest combining with other content |
| No clear data points | Opinion/thought piece | Focus on quotes, questions, and contrarian takes instead |
| Highly technical content | Dense jargon | Simplify for social; keep technical depth for email/LinkedIn |
| Content is time-sensitive | News/event coverage | Flag that derivatives should be published quickly; prioritize speed |
| Multiple topics in one piece | Unfocused source | Suggest splitting repurposing by topic; create separate derivative sets |

## Example

**User prompt:** "I just published a 2,000-word blog post about why traditional project management is broken. Turn it into social content for LinkedIn and Twitter."

**Claude responds:**

> I've analyzed your post and extracted these repurposable elements:
> - **Core thesis:** Traditional PM forces teams to plan everything upfront, which is the opposite of how successful teams actually work
> - **Key stat:** "67% of projects using waterfall methodology exceed their budget"
> - **Contrarian claim:** "Gantt charts are comforting fictions"
> - **Framework:** 4-step "Adaptive Planning" process
> - **Story:** The failed ERP implementation example
>
> Here's your content pack:
>
> **LinkedIn Posts (4):**
> 1. Contrarian hook — "Gantt charts are comforting fictions..." (story + data format)
> 2. Data-led — "67% of waterfall projects exceed budget..." (stat + framework)
> 3. Question — "When was the last time a project went according to plan?"
> 4. Framework post — "4 steps to Adaptive Planning" (step-by-step)
>
