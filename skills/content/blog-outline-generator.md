  Create a structured blog post outline from a content brief or topic.
  Use this skill whenever the user wants to outline a blog post, plan article structure,
  create a writing skeleton, needs H2/H3 headings for a post, or says "help me outline
  this article". Also trigger when chaining from content-brief-generator output. Use for
  any blog planning that needs to go from topic to detailed section-by-section outline
  with word count targets and key points. Even "I need to write about X, where do I start?"
  should trigger this skill.

# Blog Outline Generator

Creates a detailed blog post outline with H2/H3 hierarchy, key points per section, word count allocations, CTA placement, and writing notes. Takes a content brief or a simple topic and produces a ready-to-write skeleton.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementing in your CMS. If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 minutes for setup. Input is a brief or topic. Output is a structured Markdown outline. No external tools needed.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Outline a blog post about [topic]" (direct command)
- "I have a content brief, now help me plan the structure" (chaining)
- "What sections should my article on [topic] have?" (planning)
- "Create H2/H3 headings for this blog post" (specific structure)
- "Help me structure this article before I write it" (pre-writing)
- "I need to write a 2,000-word post about [topic]" (word count driven)
- "Break this topic into sections" (structural request)
- "Plan the outline for my next blog post" (general planning)
- "Turn this brief into something I can start writing" (action-oriented)
- "What should each section of this article cover?" (detail-oriented)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `topic` | string | Blog topic or target keyword | `"project management for remote teams"` |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No content strategy?** Describe your product and your top 3 customer pain points. That's enough to generate an outline.
- **No keyword research?** List 5 questions your customers frequently ask. These become your topics.
- **No brand voice guide?** Provide 2-3 examples of content you like the tone of. Claude can infer the voice from examples.
- **No performance data?** Start fresh. After publishing, track views, time-on-page, and conversions for 30 days.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `content_brief` | Markdown | `null` | Full brief from content-brief-generator |
| `target_word_count` | integer | `1,500` | Total word count target |
| `audience` | string | `"general"` | Target reader |
| `content_type` | string | `"how-to guide"` | Blog type: how-to, listicle, comparison, tutorial, opinion |
| `cta_goal` | string | `"newsletter signup"` | What the CTA should drive |
| `tone` | string | `"professional but approachable"` | Writing tone |

### Input Validation Rules

1. `topic` must not be empty (or `content_brief` must be provided)
2. `target_word_count` should be 500-10,000 (warn outside this range)
3. If `content_brief` is provided, extract topic, keywords, and structure from it

**If validation fails:** Ask the user for at minimum a topic or keyword to build around.

## Process

1. **Parse input** — Extract topic, constraints, and any brief data. If a content_brief is provided, use its structure as the starting framework.

2. **Determine content type** — Based on the topic and keywords, recommend the best format:
   - How-to guide: procedural, step-by-step
   - Listicle: numbered items, skimmable
   - Comparison: side-by-side analysis
   - Deep-dive: comprehensive coverage of one topic
   - Opinion/thought leadership: perspective-driven

3. **Generate H2 structure** — Create 4-8 H2 sections that cover the topic comprehensively:
   - Each H2 gets a descriptive heading (not generic like "Introduction")
   - Sections flow logically (problem → solution → implementation → results)
   - Allocate word count per section (proportional to importance)

4. **Add H3 subsections** — For sections over 400 words, add 2-4 H3 subsections with specific talking points.

5. **Place CTAs and internal links** — Identify where to place:
   - Primary CTA (typically after value-heavy section, before conclusion)
   - Secondary CTAs (in-content mentions, sidebar suggestions)
   - Internal link opportunities (reference existing content)

6. **Human checkpoint** — Present the outline. Ask: "Does this structure work? Should I add, remove, or reorganize any sections?"

7. **Add writing notes** — For each section, add 2-3 bullet points of key things to cover, data points to include, or angles to take.

### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Output Contract

### Output Format

| Output | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Blog outline | Markdown | Complete section-by-section outline |

### Outline Structure

```markdown
# [Blog Post Title]

**Target word count:** X,XXX words
**Content type:** [type]
**Target keyword:** [keyword]
**Audience:** [audience]
**Tone:** [tone]

---

## H2: [Section Title] (~XXX words)

**Purpose:** Why this section exists
**Key points:**
- Point 1 to cover
- Point 2 to cover
- Point 3 to cover

**Keywords to include:** [keyword1], [keyword2]

### H3: [Subsection] (~XXX words)
- Specific talking point
- Data or example to include

### H3: [Subsection] (~XXX words)
- Specific talking point

---

[Repeat for each H2]

## CTA Placement
- **Primary CTA:** [Location + action]
- **Secondary CTA:** [Location + action]

## Internal Links
- [Anchor text] → [target page/topic]

## Writing Notes
- Tone reminders
- Things to avoid
- Key differentiators to emphasize
```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### WordPress
1. Log in to wp-admin → Posts → Add New
2. Paste the content outline into the editor
3. Use the Heading blocks (H2, H3) for structure
4. Add Featured Image and set Category/Tags before publishing

### Google Docs (Collaboration)
1. Create a new Google Doc
2. Paste the output and use Suggesting Mode for team review
3. Use Insert → Table of Contents for navigation
4. Share with stakeholders for feedback

### CMS-Agnostic
1. Copy Markdown output as-is into any CMS that supports Markdown
2. For HTML-based CMS platforms, convert Markdown to HTML using any converter
3. Adapt headings and formatting to match your site's style guide

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Topic too broad | "marketing" with no angle | Ask user to narrow: audience, specific aspect, or goal |
| Topic too narrow | Very specific micro-topic | Suggest expanding to fill word count, or recommend shorter format |
| Word count mismatch | 500 words requested for complex topic | Recommend minimum word count or suggest splitting into series |
| No clear angle | Generic topic with no unique perspective | Suggest 3 angles and ask user to pick one |
| Content brief conflicts | Brief says one thing, user says another | Prioritize user's direct input; flag the discrepancy |

## How to Get Your Data

### From content-brief-generator

Run the content brief generator first with your target keyword. Pass its Markdown output directly as `content_brief` input to this skill.

### From scratch

Just provide a topic and optional constraints. No data export needed — this skill works from a topic description alone.

## Example

**User prompt:** "Outline a 2,000-word blog post about project management for remote teams. We sell a PM tool called TaskFlow. Target audience is startup CTOs."

**Claude output:**

> # How to Manage Projects Across Time Zones (Without Losing Your Mind)
>
> **Target word count:** 2,000 words | **Type:** How-to guide | **Audience:** Startup CTOs
