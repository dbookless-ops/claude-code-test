# Community Management Playbook

Creates a comprehensive community management playbook with response templates, escalation workflows, engagement tactics, and moderation guidelines for social media communities.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~20-40 min scheduling in Buffer / Hootsuite / native platform. If implementing output in a platform, add 20-30 min for team training. Input is brand info and community context. Output is a Markdown playbook with templates and workflows.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Build a community management playbook" (full playbook)
- "I need response templates for social media" (templates)
- "How should we handle negative comments?" (crisis/moderation)
- "Create community guidelines for our Facebook group" (guidelines)
- "Social media customer service SOP" (process)
- "How do we engage our community better?" (engagement)
- "Troll management strategy" (moderation)
- "Build an escalation path for social issues" (workflow)
- "Community health metrics — what should we track?" (measurement)
- "Brand voice guide for community managers" (voice)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Brand/Product | Text | What your brand does and its personality |
| Platforms | Text | Where your community lives (Facebook, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) |
| Community Size | Text | Approximate size and activity level |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No community yet?** Describe your target audience and which platform you're considering. Claude will generate a launch playbook.
- **No brand voice guide?** Share 3-5 example responses you've given that felt "right." Claude will infer tone guidelines.
- **No historical issues?** Claude uses common community management scenarios (complaints, spam, trolls, crises) to build your playbook.
- **No metrics baseline?** Start tracking response time, sentiment, and engagement rate. After 30 days, you'll have a baseline.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Brand Voice | Text | Tone descriptors (friendly, professional, witty, etc.) |
| Common Issues | Text list | Top 5 questions/complaints you receive |
| Team Size | Number | How many community managers |
| Industry | Text | For compliance-specific templates (healthcare, finance, etc.) |
| Existing Guidelines | Text | Current community rules, if any |

## Process

### Step 1: Community Audit
- Map all community touchpoints (platforms, groups, forums)
- Identify community types: support, engagement, advocacy, learning
- Assess current response time and coverage gaps
- Flag high-risk scenarios specific to the industry

### Step 2: Response Framework
Build tiered response templates:

| Tier | Type | Response Time | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Positive mentions, simple questions | < 1 hour | Community manager |
| 2 | Complaints, feature requests | < 4 hours | Community manager |
| 3 | Escalations, legal/PR risks | < 30 min | Manager + PR |
| 4 | Crisis (viral negative, data breach) | < 15 min | Leadership + Legal |

### Step 3: Template Library
Generate templates for:
- Positive engagement (thank you, reshare, amplification)
- FAQ responses (pricing, features, availability)
- Complaint handling (acknowledge, investigate, resolve)
- Negative review responses (empathy, action, follow-up)
- Troll/spam management (warning, mute, ban criteria)
- Crisis holding statements
- Community milestone celebrations

### Step 4: Engagement Playbook
- Daily engagement routines (proactive commenting, UGC spotlighting)
- Weekly community activations (polls, AMAs, challenges)
- Monthly community health reviews
- Advocacy program mechanics (identifying and nurturing superfans)

### Step 5: Moderation Guidelines
- Acceptable use policy
- Warning → mute → ban escalation ladder
- Content removal criteria (hate speech, spam, off-topic, misinformation)
- Appeals process

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Response templates should be customized to your brand voice over time. Track which templates get positive reactions and iterate. Community management is more art than science — use these as starting frameworks, not rigid scripts.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review all templates for brand voice alignment, legal compliance (especially in regulated industries), and cultural sensitivity before distributing to your team.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Hootsuite 2024 Social Trends Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Sprout Social / Hootsuite
1. Import response templates into Saved Replies / Quick Responses
2. Set up auto-assignment rules matching the escalation tiers
3. Configure response time SLA alerts
4. Create team-specific inboxes for different issue types

### Discord
1. Set up channels matching your community structure (#welcome, #support, #general)
2. Configure AutoMod with your moderation keywords
3. Create role-based permissions matching escalation tiers
4. Pin community guidelines in #rules channel

### Facebook Groups
1. Post community guidelines as a pinned announcement
2. Set up membership questions aligned with your guidelines
3. Enable Admin Assist for keyword-based auto-moderation
4. Create Saved Replies for common questions

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Templates sound robotic | Over-reliance on scripts | Add personalization fields; train team on adapting tone |
| Escalation bottleneck | Too many Tier 3 issues | Review tier criteria; empower Tier 1 to handle more |
| Community feels ignored | Slow response times | Set platform-specific response SLAs; hire more moderators |
| Troll takeover | No moderation framework | Implement proactive moderation; use platform tools |

## How to Get Your Data

- **No data needed**: Describe your brand, platforms, and community size — Claude generates the full playbook
- **Existing templates**: Paste your current response templates for Claude to organize and improve
- **Community feedback**: Export community survey results or complaint logs for tailored templates

## Example

**Input**: "Community management playbook for a B2B SaaS company. Platforms: LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack community (500 members). Brand tone: helpful, knowledgeable, slightly informal. Common issues: billing questions, feature requests, integration bugs."

**Output**: Full playbook with 15+ response templates across 4 tiers. Engagement calendar with weekly LinkedIn polls, monthly Slack AMAs, and quarterly community spotlights. Moderation guidelines for Slack (spam, self-promotion limits, off-topic rules). Escalation path: Community Manager → Support Lead → Product Manager → VP of Customer Success. Metrics: response time target <2 hours, community NPS quarterly, engagement rate >15%.
