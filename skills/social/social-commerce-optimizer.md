# Social Commerce Optimizer

Analyzes and optimizes social commerce performance across platforms — product catalog setup, shoppable content strategy, conversion funnel optimization, and live shopping planning.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~20-40 min scheduling in Buffer / Hootsuite / native platform. If implementing output in a platform, add 20-30 min for catalog/shop setup. Input is product catalog info and social commerce data. Output is Markdown optimization report with action plan.

## User Intent Mapping

- "How do I set up Instagram Shopping?" (platform setup)
- "Our social commerce conversion rate is low" (optimization)
- "TikTok Shop strategy for our brand" (platform-specific)
- "Best practices for shoppable posts" (content strategy)
- "Live shopping plan for our product launch" (live commerce)
- "Optimize our Facebook Shop" (storefront)
- "Social commerce funnel analysis" (analytics)
- "Which products should we feature on social?" (merchandising)
- "Pinterest shopping strategy" (platform-specific)
- "Social checkout vs. website checkout — what converts better?" (funnel decision)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Products/Services | Text | What you sell, price range, top sellers |
| Platform(s) | Text | Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, or all |
| Current Setup | Text | What you've already set up (catalog, shop, tagging) |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No social shop yet?** Describe your products and target platform. Claude generates a setup checklist and launch strategy.
- **No sales data?** Start with product tagging on your top 5 posts. Track clicks and saves for 2 weeks to establish a baseline.
- **No product catalog?** List your top 10 products with names, prices, and image descriptions. That's enough to start.
- **No competitor benchmarks?** Claude uses industry averages. Browse competitor shops on Instagram/TikTok for qualitative benchmarks.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sales Data | CSV | Product, platform, clicks, conversions, revenue |
| Top Products | Text list | Best-selling items to prioritize |
| Content Performance | CSV | Posts with product tags, engagement, click-through |
| Target Audience | Text | Demographics and shopping behavior |
| Budget | Text | Ad spend for boosting shoppable content |

## Process

### Step 1: Platform Audit
Evaluate current setup per platform:

| Platform | Shop Features | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram | Shop tab, product tags, Checkout, Live Shopping | Visual products, fashion, beauty, home |
| TikTok | TikTok Shop, product links, LIVE shopping, affiliate | Impulse buys, trending items, sub-$50 products |
| Facebook | Facebook Shops, Marketplace, product tags | Broad demographics, local businesses |
| Pinterest | Product Pins, Shopping ads, Catalogs | Home decor, fashion, DIY, wedding, food |

### Step 2: Catalog Optimization
- Product title optimization (keyword-rich, benefit-led)
- Product description best practices (features + social proof)
- Image requirements per platform (dimensions, lifestyle vs. product shots)
- Collection/category structure recommendations
- Pricing display strategy (anchor pricing, bundles)

### Step 3: Shoppable Content Strategy
- Content mix: product showcases (30%), lifestyle/UGC (40%), educational (20%), promotional (10%)
- Product tagging frequency and placement
- Carousel vs. single image vs. Reels for product content
- UGC integration (customer photos with product tags)
- Seasonal and trending product promotion calendar

### Step 4: Conversion Funnel Optimization
- Discovery → Click → Cart → Purchase funnel analysis
- Friction point identification (checkout abandonment, price hesitation)
- In-app checkout vs. website redirect decision framework
- Retargeting strategy for social commerce abandoners
- Social proof integration (reviews, ratings, "X people bought this")

### Step 5: Live Shopping Plan (if applicable)
- Live shopping event calendar
- Host selection (founder, influencer, employee)
- Product staging and demo flow
- Limited-time offers and urgency mechanics
- Post-live content repurposing

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Social commerce is evolving rapidly. Platform features change frequently — verify current capabilities before implementing. Conversion benchmarks vary wildly by product category and price point. Test for minimum 2 weeks before drawing conclusions.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review product catalog for pricing accuracy, inventory availability, and platform policy compliance (prohibited products vary by platform) before publishing.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Buffer 2024 State of Social, and Later 2024 Social Media Industry Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Low click-through on tags | Poor product placement in content | Feature products prominently; use lifestyle contexts |
| High cart abandonment | Checkout friction or price shock | Simplify checkout; add trust signals; test free shipping |
| Shop not approved | Policy violations or missing info | Review platform commerce policies; fix catalog issues |
| Low live shopping attendance | Poor promotion or wrong timing | Promote 48 hours in advance; test different time slots |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Instagram**: Insights → Content → Shopping → Product performance
- **TikTok Shop**: Seller Center → Analytics → Product performance
- **Facebook**: Commerce Manager → Performance → Product insights
- **Pinterest**: Analytics → Conversions → Product Pin performance
- **Manual**: Track tagged product posts and compare engagement vs. non-tagged

## Example

**Input**: "Optimize social commerce for a DTC skincare brand. Platforms: Instagram + TikTok. 15 SKUs, $25-$65 price range. Currently have Instagram Shop set up but low conversion. No TikTok Shop yet."

**Output**: Instagram audit: catalog images are product-only (need lifestyle shots), no collections set up, product tags only on 20% of posts. Recommendations: create 4 collections (Routine Builder, Best Sellers, Gifts, New Arrivals), increase tagging to 80% of posts, add UGC with product tags. TikTok Shop launch plan: register seller account, upload top 5 SKUs, partner with 3-5 micro-influencers for affiliate program, plan weekly LIVE shopping demos. Content calendar: 3 shoppable Reels/week on Instagram, 2 TikTok product videos/week. Quick win: add "Shop the Look" carousel to top 10 performing posts (expected 2x click-through lift).
