# Page Speed Optimizer

Analyzes and optimizes page speed and Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) with prioritized fixes for SEO ranking improvements and better user experience.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementation in Google Search Console / CMS. If implementing fixes, add 2-10 hours depending on issues. Input is PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse data. Output is Markdown optimization plan with prioritized fixes.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Our site is slow — how to fix it" (general speed)
- "Core Web Vitals failing in GSC" (CWV)
- "LCP is too high — how to reduce it" (specific metric)
- "CLS issues on mobile" (layout shift)
- "INP is failing — interaction is slow" (responsiveness)
- "Improve our Lighthouse score" (Lighthouse)
- "Image optimization for page speed" (images)
- "Render-blocking CSS and JavaScript" (resources)
- "Page speed for SEO rankings" (SEO focus)
- "TTFB is too slow" (server)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Site URL | Text | Pages to optimize |
| PageSpeed Data | Text/Screenshot | PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse results |
| Priority | Text | SEO rankings, user experience, conversion rate |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No performance data?** Run PageSpeed Insights (free) on your top 5 pages and paste the results. Claude prioritizes fixes by impact.
- **No developer access?** Claude identifies which fixes need a developer and which can be done via CMS settings or plugins.
- **No CDN?** Claude includes CDN setup as a recommendation with free options (Cloudflare free tier).
- **No image optimization?** Claude provides specific image compression recommendations and format conversion guidance.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CrUX Data | Text | Chrome User Experience Report (field data) |
| Hosting Info | Text | Server, CDN, hosting provider |
| CMS/Framework | Text | WordPress, React, Next.js, Shopify, etc. |
| Page Types | Text | Which page types are slowest |
| Traffic Volume | Text | Monthly visitors (affects optimization priority) |

## Process

### Step 1: Core Web Vitals Assessment
| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|---|---|---|---|
| LCP | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | > 4.0s |
| INP | ≤ 200ms | 200-500ms | > 500ms |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | > 0.25 |

### Step 2: LCP Optimization
Common LCP issues and fixes:
- Slow server response (TTFB > 800ms) → CDN, server upgrade, caching
- Render-blocking resources → defer non-critical CSS/JS, inline critical CSS
- Large hero images → WebP/AVIF format, responsive sizing, preload
- Client-side rendering → server-side rendering or static generation
- Unoptimized web fonts → font-display: swap, preload fonts

### Step 3: INP Optimization
- Long JavaScript tasks → break into smaller chunks, use web workers
- Heavy event handlers → debounce, requestAnimationFrame
- Third-party scripts → defer, lazy load, or remove
- DOM size → reduce node count, virtualize long lists
- Main thread blocking → optimize JavaScript execution

### Step 4: CLS Optimization
- Images without dimensions → add width/height attributes
- Ads/embeds without reserved space → set explicit dimensions
- Dynamic content insertion → reserve space before loading
- Web fonts causing FOIT/FOUT → font-display: swap + preload
- Late-loading CSS → inline critical CSS above the fold

### Step 5: Resource Optimization
- Image optimization: WebP/AVIF, responsive srcset, lazy loading
- JavaScript: minify, tree-shake, code-split, defer
- CSS: minify, remove unused, inline critical CSS
- Fonts: subset, preload, self-host
- Third-party scripts: audit, defer, or remove unnecessary ones

### Step 6: Infrastructure Optimization
- CDN implementation for global delivery
- Browser caching headers (Cache-Control, Expires)
- Compression (Brotli > Gzip)
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled
- DNS prefetch and preconnect for third-party origins

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Lab data (Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights) shows potential issues; field data (CrUX) shows real user experience. Google uses field data (CrUX) for ranking signals, not lab data. Performance varies by device and network — optimize for the 75th percentile of users. CWV improvements take 28 days to reflect in CrUX data after deployment.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Have a developer review all optimization recommendations before implementation. Test changes in staging environment first. Performance optimizations can occasionally break functionality — verify all features work after changes.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Google 2024 Marketing Measurement Guide for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

- CLS: [current] → [target]
```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### WordPress
1. Install caching plugin (WP Rocket, LiteSpeed Cache, or W3 Total Cache)
2. Install image optimization plugin (ShortPixel, Imagify, or Smush)
3. Use Autoptimize or Perfmatters for CSS/JS optimization
4. Enable lazy loading for images (native or plugin-based)
5. Use a CDN plugin (Cloudflare, BunnyCDN, or hosting CDN)

### Shopify
1. Compress and convert images to WebP before upload
2. Minimize app installs (each adds JavaScript)
3. Use system fonts or preload custom fonts
4. Defer non-critical JavaScript using theme.liquid
5. Enable Shopify CDN (automatic) and set cache headers

### Next.js / React
1. Use next/image for automatic image optimization
2. Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
3. Enable server-side rendering or static generation for key pages
4. Use React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting
5. Configure next.config.js for compression and caching

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Optimization broke layout | CSS changes caused styling issues | Revert; test critical CSS inlining more carefully |
| Lazy loading hurt LCP | Hero image was lazy loaded | Exclude above-fold images from lazy loading; preload LCP image |
| Third-party removal broke features | Essential script was deferred or removed | Re-add with async attribute; find lighter alternative |
| No CrUX improvement after 30 days | Changes didn't reach enough real users or lab-only issues | Verify deployment; check CrUX data volume; focus on field data issues |

## How to Get Your Data

- **PageSpeed Insights**: pagespeed.web.dev → enter URL → review results
- **Lighthouse**: Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab → run audit
- **CrUX**: GSC → Core Web Vitals report; or CrUX Dashboard on BigQuery
- **WebPageTest**: webpagetest.org → detailed waterfall analysis
- **No tools**: Paste your site URL — Claude provides recommendations based on common issues for your CMS

## Example

**Input**: "Page speed optimization for a WordPress blog. LCP: 4.8s, INP: 310ms, CLS: 0.18. Lighthouse score: 42. Using 12 plugins, no CDN, images are PNG/JPEG, no caching plugin. 500K monthly visitors."

**Output**: Critical fixes: (1) Install WP Rocket caching plugin — expected LCP improvement 1.5-2s alone. (2) Convert images to WebP via ShortPixel — 25 hero images average 2.4MB each (target <200KB). (3) Enable Cloudflare free CDN — TTFB improvement ~40%. (4) Defer 8 of 12 plugin scripts (social share, analytics, chat widget) — INP improvement ~100ms. CLS fixes: add width/height to all images (theme.php edit), reserve ad space dimensions (CSS). Plugin audit: remove 3 unused plugins, replace 2 heavy plugins with lighter alternatives. Phase 1 (day 1): install WP Rocket + Cloudflare → LCP 4.8→3.0s. Phase 2 (day 2-3): image optimization → LCP 3.0→2.2s. Phase 3 (week 2): JS defer + plugin cleanup → INP 310→180ms. Expected results: Lighthouse 42→85+, all CWV passing within 2 weeks.
