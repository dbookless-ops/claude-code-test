  Design statistically sound A/B tests for marketing assets.
  Use this skill whenever the user mentions A/B testing, split testing, experiment design,
  statistical significance, sample size calculation, test duration, or says things like
  "should I A/B test this" or "how long should my test run" or "design a test for my
  landing page." Also trigger for multivariate testing design, conversion rate experiments,
  minimum detectable effect calculations, or any request to validate a marketing change.

# A/B Test Designer

Designs statistically sound A/B tests with hypothesis, variant descriptions, sample size calculation, duration estimate, success criteria, and implementation guide. Prevents common testing mistakes like stopping tests too early.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min implementing in your testing tool / CMS. If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 minutes for setup. Input is element to test + current metrics. Output is a complete test plan.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Design an A/B test for my landing page headline" (direct command)
- "How long should I run this A/B test?" (duration question)
- "How much traffic do I need to test this?" (sample size)
- "Is this result statistically significant?" (analysis)
- "What should I A/B test first?" (prioritization)
- "Set up a test for my email subject lines" (channel-specific)
- "I want to test a new pricing page" (specific asset)
- "Help me design an experiment for our signup flow" (product)
- "My boss wants to test everything — help me prioritize" (strategic)
- "Calculate the sample size for my test" (statistical)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `element_to_test` | string | What you're testing | `"Landing page headline"` |
| `baseline_rate` | float (0-1) | Current conversion rate | `0.03` (3%) |
| `daily_traffic` | integer | Daily visitors/recipients | `500` |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No landing page copy?** Paste the visible text from your page, or describe what each section says.
- **No conversion rate?** Check Google Analytics → Conversions, or estimate: signups last month ÷ page visitors last month.
- **No A/B testing tool?** Make changes sequentially and compare 2-week periods in GA4. Not as rigorous but still useful.
- **No traffic source data?** Check GA4 → Acquisition → Traffic Acquisition for your landing page URL.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `desired_lift` | float | `0.20` | Minimum relative improvement to detect (20% = 3% → 3.6%) |
| `confidence_level` | float | `0.95` | Statistical confidence (0.90, 0.95, 0.99) |
| `power` | float | `0.80` | Statistical power |
| `num_variants` | integer | `2` | Number of variants (including control) |
| `test_context` | string | `""` | Business context for hypothesis |

### Input Validation Rules

1. `baseline_rate` must be between 0 and 1
2. `daily_traffic` must be positive
3. `desired_lift` must be positive (relative, not absolute)
4. `confidence_level` must be 0.80-0.99

## Process

1. **Validate inputs and calculate sample size** using the two-proportion z-test formula:
   - n = (Zα/2 + Zβ)² × [p1(1-p1) + p2(1-p2)] / (p2 - p1)²
   - Where p1 = baseline rate, p2 = baseline × (1 + desired_lift)
   - For 95% confidence, 80% power: Zα/2 = 1.96, Zβ = 0.84

2. **Calculate test duration** — Required sample ÷ daily traffic ÷ traffic allocation (typically 100% for simple A/B). Add 1 full business cycle (minimum 7 days) to account for day-of-week effects.

3. **Write hypothesis** — Structured format: "If we [change], then [metric] will [direction] by at least [amount], because [reasoning]."

4. **Design variants** — Describe control and treatment with specific changes. Each variant tests exactly one variable.

5. **Human checkpoint** — Present test plan summary. Ask: "Does the test duration work for your timeline? Is the minimum detectable effect meaningful for your business?"

6. **Define success criteria** — Clear decision matrix:
   - Significant winner → implement winner
   - No significant difference → keep control (lower risk)
   - Significant loser → keep control, investigate why

7. **Add guardrail metrics** — Identify metrics that should NOT decrease during the test.

### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Output Contract

### Output Format

| Output | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Test plan | Markdown | Complete A/B test specification |

### Test Plan Structure

```markdown
# A/B Test Plan: [Element]

## Hypothesis
If we [change], then [metric] will [improve] by [amount], because [reasoning].

## Test Configuration
- Sample size needed: X per variant (X total)
- Test duration: X days (at X visitors/day)
- Confidence level: 95%
- Minimum detectable effect: X% relative lift
- Traffic allocation: 50/50

## Variants
- Control (A): [description]
- Treatment (B): [description]

## Success Criteria
| Outcome | Action |
|---|---|
| B wins (p < 0.05) | Implement B |
| No difference | Keep A |
| B loses | Keep A, investigate |

## Guardrail Metrics
- [Metric] must not decrease by more than X%

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] QA both variants
- [ ] Set up tracking
- [ ] Confirm even traffic split
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for minimum duration
- [ ] DO NOT peek at results before minimum duration
```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Google Optimize (or VWO/Optimizely)
1. Create a new A/B test experiment
2. Set the target URL to your landing page
3. Create variant(s) with the recommended copy changes
4. Set conversion goals matching the target action
5. Set traffic allocation (recommend 50/50 for initial tests)
6. Run for minimum 2 weeks or until statistical significance (95%+)

### Unbounce / Instapage
1. Duplicate your current landing page as a variant
2. Apply the rewritten copy sections to the variant
3. Use the built-in A/B testing feature
4. Monitor conversion rates in the dashboard

### Manual Implementation (No CRO Tool)
1. Make changes directly in your CMS/page builder
2. Track conversions via GA4 goals before and after
3. Run changes for at least 2 weeks with comparable traffic
4. Compare conversion rates manually (use a significance calculator)

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Sample size too large | Low traffic + small desired lift | Suggest testing a higher-impact change or accepting larger MDE |
| Test would take > 90 days | Insufficient traffic | Recommend a less granular test or different channel |
| Baseline rate unknown | No historical data | Recommend running for 2 weeks to establish baseline first |
| Too many variants | User wants to test 5 things | Recommend sequential tests or a multivariate approach |
| Seasonal interference | Test spans a holiday or event | Flag the risk; suggest pre/post-event test windows |

## Example

**User prompt:** "Design an A/B test for our signup page headline. Current conversion rate is 3%, we get about 800 visitors per day, and we want to detect at least a 15% improvement."

**Claude output:**

> # A/B Test Plan: Signup Page Headline
>
> ## Hypothesis
> If we change the headline from "Manage Projects Better" to "Stop Losing 5 Hours/Week to Status Meetings", then signup rate will increase by at least 15% (3.0% → 3.45%), because specific pain-point headlines outperform generic benefit headlines.
>
> ## Test Configuration
> - **Sample size needed:** 17,200 per variant (34,400 total)
> - **Test duration:** 43 days minimum (at 800 visitors/day)
> - **Confidence level:** 95% | **Power:** 80%
> - **Minimum detectable effect:** 0.45 percentage points (15% relative)
> - **Traffic allocation:** 50/50
>
> The test duration is just over 6 weeks. This is long because a 15% relative lift on a 3% baseline is a small absolute change (0.45pp). If you can accept detecting a 25% lift instead, the test drops to 18 days.
>
> ## Guardrail Metrics
> - Bounce rate must not increase by more than 5%
> - Pages per session must not decrease by more than 10%
