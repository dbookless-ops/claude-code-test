# Pricing Page Optimizer

Audits and optimizes pricing page design with plan structure, feature presentation, conversion elements, psychological pricing tactics, and A/B testing recommendations.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~60-120 min implementing in your product / tools. If implementing output, add 2-4 hours for page redesign. Input is current pricing page or plan details. Output is Markdown audit with redesigned pricing page recommendations.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Review our pricing page for conversions" (audit)
- "How should we structure our pricing tiers?" (structure)
- "Our pricing page has low conversion" (optimization)
- "Pricing page best practices" (best practices)
- "Which plan should we highlight?" (anchoring)
- "Feature comparison table design" (table design)
- "Should we show prices or use 'Contact Sales'?" (display strategy)
- "Pricing page FAQ — what questions to answer" (FAQ)
- "Freemium vs. free trial vs. paid only" (model)
- "Pricing psychology tips" (psychology)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing Plans | Text | Plan names, prices, and included features |
| Product Type | Text | SaaS, e-commerce, service, marketplace |
| Target Buyers | Text | Who's buying and their decision-making process |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No pricing page yet?** Describe your plans and features. Claude designs the page structure and copy.
- **No conversion data?** Claude audits against best practices. Set up pricing page analytics (clicks per plan, signup starts per plan) as a priority.
- **No competitor pricing?** Search competitor pricing pages and note their plan names, prices, and featured plans. Claude uses this for positioning.
- **No A/B testing tool?** Make changes sequentially and compare 2-week performance periods in analytics.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Current Conversion Rate | Number | Pricing page to signup/purchase rate |
| Plan Distribution | Text | % of customers on each plan |
| Competitor Pricing | Text | Competitor plans and pricing |
| Common Objections | Text | What prospects ask before buying |
| Annual vs. Monthly | Text | Current billing split |

## Process

### Step 1: Plan Structure Audit
Evaluate:
- Number of plans (3-4 is optimal; 5+ causes decision paralysis)
- Plan naming (avoid generic: Basic/Pro/Enterprise → use value-based names)
- Price anchoring (most expensive plan should make middle plan look reasonable)
- Feature differentiation (clear value steps between plans)
- Free tier/trial strategy (freemium vs. free trial vs. demo)

### Step 2: Pricing Psychology
Apply proven tactics:
- **Anchoring**: Show highest plan first (or highlight middle plan)
- **Charm pricing**: $29 vs. $30 (9-ending prices increase conversions 8-12%)
- **Annual discount**: Show monthly price with annual savings
- **Decoy effect**: Add a plan that makes the target plan look like the best value
- **Loss aversion**: "Save $X/year" vs. "Pay $X/month"
- **Social proof**: "Most popular" badge, customer count per plan

### Step 3: Feature Table Optimization
- Lead with benefits, not feature names
- Group features by category
- Use checkmarks for included, dashes for excluded (never X marks — too negative)
- Highlight differentiating features between plans
- Limit to 10-15 features visible (expandable for full list)

### Step 4: Conversion Elements
Must-have elements:
- Clear CTA buttons (contrasting color, action-oriented text)
- Trust signals (security badges, money-back guarantee, customer logos)
- Social proof (customer count, testimonials, case studies)
- FAQ section (addressing top 5-7 objections)
- Annual/monthly toggle with savings highlighted
- Risk reducers (free trial, no credit card required, cancel anytime)

### Step 5: Pricing Page Copy
- Headline: Value proposition, not just "Pricing"
- Subheadline: Who it's for and key benefit
- Plan descriptions: 1-2 sentence positioning for each plan
- CTA text: Specific ("Start Free Trial") not generic ("Sign Up")
- FAQ answers: Concise, objection-handling

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Pricing page optimization requires minimum 1,000 visitors and 50+ conversions to measure changes reliably. Pricing changes affect conversion AND revenue simultaneously — track both. Annual plan promotion may increase conversion rate but reduce immediate revenue (payback analysis needed). Seasonal effects and traffic source shifts can confound results.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Verify pricing accuracy with finance team before publishing. Review feature comparisons with product team for accuracy. Ensure compliance with any contractual pricing agreements. Test the complete purchase flow after changes.

> **Benchmark Context**: Good Day 1 retention is 20-30% for mobile apps and 40%+ for strong SaaS products (Amplitude/Mixpanel 2025 Benchmarks). Median net revenue retention for SaaS is ~110% (Bessemer Venture Partners 2025).

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Website/CMS
1. Create or update pricing page with recommended structure
2. Add plan highlighting (CSS border/badge for recommended plan)
3. Build annual/monthly toggle with JavaScript
4. Add FAQ accordion section
5. Implement conversion tracking on CTA clicks and plan selections

### A/B Testing (VWO/Optimizely/Google Optimize)
1. Create pricing page variant with recommended changes
2. Set conversion goal: pricing page → signup/purchase
3. Traffic split: 50/50
4. Run for minimum 2 weeks or until 95% significance

### Analytics
1. Track events: plan_selected, annual_toggled, faq_expanded, cta_clicked
2. Create funnel: pricing_page_view → plan_click → signup_start → signup_complete
3. Segment by traffic source (paid vs. organic visitors convert differently on pricing pages)

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion dropped after changes | Changed too many things at once | Revert and test one change at a time |
| Everyone picks cheapest plan | Insufficient value differentiation in higher plans | Add exclusive features to higher plans; adjust anchoring |
| High bounce rate | Prices too high for traffic source or audience mismatch | Segment analysis by source; test price anchoring |
| FAQ doesn't reduce support | Wrong questions addressed | Analyze actual support tickets to identify top objections |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Current pricing page**: Share the URL or screenshot for Claude to audit
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics → behavior flow for pricing page → track CTA clicks
- **No data**: Describe your plans and prices — Claude designs from best practices

## Example

**Input**: "Audit our pricing page: 3 plans — Starter ($19/mo), Professional ($49/mo), Business ($99/mo). Starter gets 50% of signups, Professional 35%, Business 15%. We want more Professional plan signups. Current page has no highlighted plan, generic CTAs ('Get Started'), and a 25-feature comparison table."

**Output**: Issues: (1) No visual anchoring — add "Most Popular" badge to Professional; (2) Generic CTAs — change to "Start Free Trial" (Starter), "Start Free Trial — Most Popular" (Professional), "Contact Sales" (Business); (3) 25-feature table causes analysis paralysis — reduce to top 10 differentiating features, add "See all features" expandable; (4) No annual pricing shown — add toggle with "Save 20%" badge; (5) No social proof — add customer count and 2 testimonials. Pricing psychology: add annual pricing ($15/$39/$79 annually) to make monthly feel expensive by comparison. Reposition plans: Starter → "For individuals", Professional → "For growing teams" (most value), Business → "For organizations." Quick wins: highlight Professional plan (CSS change, 30 min), add annual toggle (2-hour dev), shorten feature table (1 hour). A/B test: current page vs. highlighted Professional plan — expected shift: Professional from 35% to 45-50% of signups.
