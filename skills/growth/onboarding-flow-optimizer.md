# Onboarding Flow Optimizer

Analyzes and optimizes user onboarding flows to reduce time-to-value, increase activation rates, and improve the new user experience through personalized onboarding paths and progressive disclosure.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~60-120 min implementing in your product / tools. If implementing output, add 1-4 weeks for development. Input is current onboarding flow and activation data. Output is Markdown optimization plan with redesigned flow.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Our users sign up but don't activate" (activation problem)
- "Design an onboarding flow for our app" (new design)
- "Reduce our onboarding drop-off" (optimization)
- "What's our aha moment?" (activation analysis)
- "Onboarding checklist for new users" (checklist design)
- "Personalized onboarding by user type" (segmentation)
- "Onboarding email sequence" (email design)
- "Product tour best practices" (tour design)
- "Time to value is too long" (speed optimization)
- "Compare self-serve vs. guided onboarding" (strategy)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Product | Text | What your product does |
| Current Onboarding | Text | Steps new users go through today |
| Activation Metric | Text | What counts as an "activated" user |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No activation metric?** Describe the moment users get value. Claude helps define your activation event (e.g., "created first project", "sent first email", "connected first integration").
- **No onboarding data?** Walk through your signup as a new user and list every step. Count the steps — that's your starting point.
- **No drop-off data?** Set up funnel tracking in your analytics tool. After 2 weeks, you'll see where users drop off.
- **No user feedback?** Interview 5-10 churned users. Ask: "What was confusing when you first signed up?" The patterns will be clear.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Funnel Data | CSV | Step, users_entered, users_completed, completion_rate |
| User Segments | Text | Different user types with different needs |
| Time to Activation | Number | Average days from signup to activation |
| Churned User Feedback | Text | Why users didn't activate |
| Competitor Onboarding | Text | How competitors onboard users |

## Process

### Step 1: Aha Moment Identification
Find the action that correlates most with retention:
- What do retained users do in their first session that churned users don't?
- How quickly do retained users reach this action?
- Can this action be reached in under 5 minutes?

### Step 2: Current Flow Audit
Evaluate each step:
- Is it necessary for reaching the aha moment?
- Can it be deferred to after activation?
- Does it cause drop-off? (>20% drop at any step is a red flag)
- Does it add value or just collect information?

### Step 3: Flow Redesign
Principles:
- **Reduce steps**: Cut anything between signup and aha moment
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show features as users need them, not all at once
- **Quick win first**: Let users experience value before asking for investment (data, settings, payment)
- **Personalize**: Ask one question to route users to relevant onboarding path
- **Celebrate progress**: Mark milestones to motivate completion

### Step 4: Multi-Channel Onboarding
| Channel | Purpose | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| In-app | Core onboarding flow, tooltips, checklists | Immediate |
| Email | Nudges, tips, re-engagement | Day 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 |
| In-app messages | Feature discovery, milestone celebration | Triggered by behavior |
| Video/Tour | Complex feature explanation | First-time feature use |
| Human touch | High-value accounts, complex products | Day 1-3 (sales-assisted) |

### Step 5: Onboarding Metrics Dashboard
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Signup-to-Activation Rate | % who reach aha moment | 40-60% |
| Time to Activation | Days from signup to activation | <24 hours |
| Onboarding Completion Rate | % who complete all steps | 70%+ |
| Day 1 / Day 7 Retention | % returning after 1/7 days | 40%+ / 25%+ |

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Onboarding changes need minimum 500 new users per variant to measure activation rate changes reliably. Small products should test sequentially (before/after) rather than A/B testing. Day 7 and Day 30 retention are lagging metrics — use activation rate as a leading indicator. Interview qualitative feedback alongside quantitative data for a complete picture.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review redesigned flow with actual users (5 user tests minimum) before full rollout. Verify that removed steps don't break downstream features. Ensure onboarding emails comply with CAN-SPAM/GDPR. Test on mobile if applicable.

> **Benchmark Context**: Good Day 1 retention is 20-30% for mobile apps and 40%+ for strong SaaS products (Amplitude/Mixpanel 2025 Benchmarks). Median net revenue retention for SaaS is ~110% (Bessemer Venture Partners 2025).

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Product Analytics (Mixpanel/Amplitude/PostHog)
1. Define activation event
2. Build onboarding funnel: signup → each step → activation
3. Segment by user type to find different aha moments
4. Set up retention curves comparing activated vs. non-activated users

### In-App Onboarding (Appcues/Userflow/Chameleon)
1. Build product tour following the optimized flow
2. Create onboarding checklist widget
3. Set up triggered tooltips for feature discovery
4. Configure completion tracking and analytics

### Email (Customer.io/Intercom/HubSpot)
1. Build triggered email sequence based on user behavior
2. Suppress emails when in-app actions are completed
3. Create re-engagement triggers for users who stall
4. A/B test subject lines and send times

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Activation didn't improve | Wrong aha moment identified | Re-analyze retained vs. churned user behaviors |
| Users skip onboarding | Too many steps or perceived low value | Make first step deliver immediate value |
| Personalization overwhelmed users | Too many paths or questions upfront | Simplify to 1-2 segmentation questions |
| Emails ignored | Wrong timing or generic content | Test behavioral triggers vs. time-based; personalize content |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Product analytics**: Mixpanel/Amplitude → Funnels → Onboarding steps
- **User interviews**: Talk to 5 churned and 5 retained users about their first experience
- **No data**: Walk through your own signup flow, count steps, time each one — that's your audit

## Example

**Input**: "Optimize onboarding for a CRM tool. Current flow: signup → verify email → company info form (12 fields) → invite team → import contacts → set up pipeline → create first deal. Activation: 'Create first deal.' Current activation rate: 18%. Time to activation: 4.2 days."

**Output**: Problem: 7 steps before value, 12-field form is a wall. Aha moment confirmed: users who create a deal in day 1 retain 4x better. Optimized flow: (1) Signup (email only) → (2) "What do you sell?" (1 question, auto-generates sample pipeline) → (3) Create first deal (guided, with sample data pre-filled) → aha moment reached in <3 minutes. Deferred: email verification (to day 2), company info (progressive, collect over first week), team invite (prompt after 3rd deal), contact import (prompt after pipeline is set up). Email sequence: Day 0 — welcome + quick win tip; Day 1 — "Import your contacts in 60 seconds"; Day 3 — "Invite your team"; Day 7 — success story from similar company. Expected impact: activation rate from 18% to 35-45%, time to activation from 4.2 days to <1 hour.
