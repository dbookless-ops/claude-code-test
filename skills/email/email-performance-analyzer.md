> **How this skill works:** You export your email campaign performance data from your ESP (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Braze, etc.) as a CSV, and Claude analyzes it. Claude cannot connect to live email platforms or pull data directly — you bring the data, Claude brings the analysis.

# Email Performance Analyzer

Analyzes email campaign performance with metric benchmarking, trend identification, segment-level insights, and actionable optimization recommendations for improving email program ROI.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-45 min setup in Mailchimp / Klaviyo / HubSpot. If implementing recommendations, add 1-3 hours. Input is email performance exports from your ESP. Output is Markdown performance analysis with optimization plan.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Analyze our email performance for this quarter" (period analysis)
- "Why are our open rates declining?" (diagnosis)
- "Email campaign report for the board" (executive report)
- "Compare our email metrics to industry benchmarks" (benchmarking)
- "Which email campaigns performed best?" (campaign ranking)
- "Email ROI analysis" (ROI)
- "Segment-level email performance" (segmentation)
- "Our click rates are low — what's wrong?" (metric diagnosis)
- "Email program health check" (health assessment)
- "Month-over-month email trends" (trends)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Campaign Data | CSV/Text | Campaign name, date, sends, opens, clicks, conversions, revenue |
| Time Period | Text | Reporting period and comparison period |
| Industry | Text | For relevant benchmarking |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No export?** Summarize your last 5-10 campaigns with sends, opens, clicks, and any conversion data. Claude can work with manual data.
- **No revenue attribution?** Claude analyzes engagement metrics (opens, clicks, unsubscribes) and recommends conversion tracking setup.
- **No historical data?** This analysis becomes your baseline. Claude sets targets based on industry benchmarks.
- **No segmented data?** Claude analyzes aggregate data and recommends segmentation as an improvement.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Segment Performance | CSV | Metrics broken down by subscriber segment |
| Automation Performance | CSV | Flow-level metrics for automated emails |
| Revenue Data | CSV | Revenue attributed to email campaigns |
| List Growth | Text | Subscriber growth and churn rates |
| Competitor Benchmarks | Text | Known competitor email metrics |

## Process

### Step 1: Metric Overview
| Metric | Formula | Your Rate | Industry Avg | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open Rate | Opens / Delivered | [%] | [see benchmarks] | [above/below] |
| Click Rate | Clicks / Delivered | [%] | [see benchmarks] | [above/below] |
| CTOR | Clicks / Opens | [%] | [see benchmarks] | [above/below] |
| Unsubscribe Rate | Unsubs / Delivered | [%] | [see benchmarks] | [above/below] |
| Bounce Rate | Bounces / Sent | [%] | [see benchmarks] | [above/below] |
| Conversion Rate | Conversions / Clicks | [%] | [see benchmarks] | [above/below] |

### Step 2: Trend Analysis
- Month-over-month metric trends (3-6 month view)
- Seasonal patterns identification
- Correlation between send volume and engagement
- List growth vs. engagement relationship
- Campaign type performance comparison

### Step 3: Campaign-Level Analysis
- Top 5 and bottom 5 campaigns by primary metric
- Common characteristics of high performers (subject line style, content type, send day)
- Campaign type benchmarking (newsletter vs. promotional vs. automated)
- Send time analysis across campaigns

### Step 4: Diagnostic Framework
| Symptom | Likely Causes | Investigation |
|---|---|---|
| Low open rate | Poor subject lines, bad send time, deliverability issues | Test subjects; check spam rate; review sender reputation |
| Low click rate | Weak CTAs, irrelevant content, poor design | Audit CTA placement; check mobile rendering; review content relevance |
| High unsubscribe | Over-emailing, irrelevant content, expectations mismatch | Check frequency; segment audience; review signup promise |
| High bounce | Stale list, bad data sources | Clean list; verify acquisition channels; remove role addresses |

### Step 5: Recommendations
Prioritize by impact and effort:
- Quick wins (< 1 hour, immediate impact)
- Medium-term improvements (1-2 weeks)
- Strategic initiatives (1-3 months)

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Open rates are less reliable since Apple MPP (Mail Privacy Protection) — inflated by 10-30% for audiences with high Apple Mail usage. Use click rate as primary engagement metric. Single campaign metrics have high variance — judge by 10+ campaign averages. Industry benchmarks vary significantly by sub-industry, list quality, and send frequency.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Verify data accuracy before sharing reports with stakeholders. Context matters: algorithm changes, seasonal effects, and list growth affect metrics independently of campaign quality.

> **Benchmark Context**: Average email open rate is 42.35% and click-through rate is 2.09% (MailerLite 2025 Email Marketing Benchmarks). Average email ROI is $36 per $1 spent (Forbes Advisor, 2025). Automated emails achieve 42.1% open rates and 5.4% click rates, generating 320% more revenue than manual campaigns (Genesys Growth, 2025).

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Data Collection
1. Export campaign data from ESP (all campaigns for the period)
2. Export automation/flow performance data separately
3. Pull revenue attribution data from e-commerce platform or CRM
4. Export list growth data (new subscribers, unsubscribes, bounces)

### Reporting Setup
1. Create a reporting template in Google Sheets or Looker Studio
2. Set up automated ESP data exports (weekly or monthly)
3. Build comparison views: MoM, YoY, campaign type, segment
4. Schedule recurring analysis cadence (monthly recommended)

### ESP-Specific Exports
- **Mailchimp**: Reports → Export to CSV; Audience → Growth History
- **Klaviyo**: Analytics → Metrics → Export; Flows → Analytics
- **HubSpot**: Marketing → Email → Analyze; Export performance data
- **SendGrid**: Statistics → Category Comparison → Export

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Misleading open rates | Apple MPP inflation | Use click rate as primary metric; segment Apple Mail users |
| Revenue misattribution | Wrong attribution window or model | Standardize attribution window (24h click, 7-day open); document model |
| Comparing incomparable campaigns | Different segments, goals, or send sizes | Normalize by segment and campaign type; compare like-to-like |
| Analysis paralysis | Too many metrics without prioritization | Focus on 3-5 KPIs aligned with business goals |

## How to Get Your Data

- **ESP export**: Campaign reports → export all campaigns for the period as CSV
- **Revenue**: E-commerce platform → orders attributed to email; or ESP revenue tracking
- **Benchmarks**: Mailchimp publishes industry benchmarks; Campaign Monitor annual report
- **No export**: Manually compile last 10 campaign metrics from ESP dashboard

## Example

**Input**: "Analyze Q4 email performance. E-commerce (home goods). 45 campaigns sent. Average open rate dropped from 28% to 22%. Click rate steady at 3.1%. Revenue from email: $180K. List: 65K subscribers."

**Output**: Health: needs attention — open rate decline is concerning but click rate holding suggests engaged readers are still engaging. Diagnosis: open rate decline likely driven by 3 factors: (1) Apple MPP adoption increasing (estimate 15% of opens are auto-opens), (2) list grew 18% in Q4 from holiday promotions — new subscribers haven't been segmented, (3) increased send frequency (3.5x/week in Q4 vs. 2x in Q3). Top campaigns: Holiday Gift Guide (38% open, 6.2% click, $32K revenue), Black Friday Preview (31% open, 5.8% click, $28K revenue). Bottom: weekly newsletters sent Tuesday had consistently lowest engagement. Revenue per email: $4K average — top quartile campaigns averaged $8.5K. Recommendations: (1) Segment Q4 holiday signups into separate nurture flow (quick win), (2) Reduce sending frequency to 2x/week for non-VIP segments, (3) Shift primary metric from opens to clicks given MPP impact, (4) A/B test send day — current Tuesday performance is 25% below Thursday sends. Q1 targets: click rate 3.5%, email revenue $200K, unsubscribe rate <0.15%.
