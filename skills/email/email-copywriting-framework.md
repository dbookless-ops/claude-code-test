## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Campaign Goal | Text | What you want the email to achieve |
| Audience | Text | Who you're writing for |
| Offer/Message | Text | What you're promoting or communicating |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No audience insights?** Describe your ideal customer. Claude writes copy tailored to that persona.
- **No brand voice guide?** Share 2-3 emails you've liked the tone of. Claude infers your voice.
- **No performance data?** Claude uses best-practice frameworks. Track performance on the first send to establish baselines.
- **First time writing emails?** Claude provides complete, ready-to-send copy with explanations of why each element works.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Brand Voice | Text | Tone descriptors (casual, professional, witty, etc.) |
| Product Details | Text | Features, benefits, pricing |
| Past Winners | Text | Subject lines or emails that performed well |
| Constraints | Text | Character limits, compliance requirements |
| Urgency | Text | Time-sensitive elements (deadlines, limited stock) |

## Process

### Step 1: Framework Selection
| Framework | Best For | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) | Pain-point driven products | Problem → make it worse → your solution |
| AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) | Broad promotions | Grab attention → build interest → create desire → CTA |
| BAB (Before-After-Bridge) | Transformation products | Current state → desired state → how to get there |
| 4 Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push) | High-ticket offers | Bold claim → paint the outcome → evidence → CTA |
| Story-based | Brand building, loyalty | Character + conflict + resolution + lesson |

### Step 2: Subject Line Writing
Formulas that drive opens:
- **Curiosity gap**: "The [thing] most [audience] get wrong about [topic]"
- **Benefit-driven**: "Get [benefit] in [timeframe]"
- **Question**: "Are you making this [topic] mistake?"
- **Social proof**: "[Number] [audience] already [action]"
- **Urgency**: "[Time] left to [benefit/save]"
- **Personalization**: "[Name], your [personalized detail]"
- Rules: 30-50 characters for mobile, no ALL CAPS, avoid spam triggers, preview text complements (doesn't repeat) subject

### Step 3: Body Copy Structure
- **Opening line**: Hook that continues the subject line promise (no "Hi [Name], I hope you're well")
- **First paragraph**: Establish relevance — why should they care?
- **Middle**: Value delivery — benefits, proof, story
- **CTA section**: Clear, specific action with reason to act now
- **P.S. line**: Second chance at CTA or add urgency (45% of readers scan to P.S. first)

### Step 4: CTA Optimization
- Use action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Claim", "Download" (not "Click Here" or "Submit")
- Add value: "Start My Free Trial" vs. "Sign Up"
- Create urgency when genuine: "Claim Your Spot (12 left)"
- Button vs. text link: buttons get 28% more clicks
- Single primary CTA per email (repeat 2-3 times in long emails)
- Place first CTA above the fold

### Step 5: Persuasion Psychology
- **Scarcity**: Limited quantity or time ("Only 50 spots left")
- **Social proof**: Numbers, testimonials, logos ("Join 10,000+ marketers")
- **Reciprocity**: Give value before asking ("Free guide inside")
- **Authority**: Expert endorsements, credentials, data
- **Loss aversion**: Frame as what they'll miss, not what they'll gain
- **Specificity**: Specific numbers build credibility ("37% increase" vs. "big improvement")

### Step 6: Copy Review Checklist
- [ ] Subject line creates curiosity or promises clear benefit
- [ ] Opening line hooks immediately (no throat-clearing)
- [ ] One clear message per email
- [ ] Benefits > features
- [ ] CTA is specific and action-oriented
- [ ] Mobile-friendly length (under 200 words for promotional)
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] No jargon the reader wouldn't use

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Email copy performance is highly audience-dependent — what works for one brand may not work for another. A/B test subject lines on every send. Copy frameworks are starting points, not formulas — adapt based on your brand voice and audience feedback. Short emails (under 125 words) generally outperform long emails for promotional sends; long emails work better for educational content.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review all email copy for factual accuracy, brand voice alignment, and legal compliance (especially claims, pricing, and deadlines). Ensure urgency and scarcity claims are genuine — false urgency damages trust.

> **Benchmark Context**: Average email open rate is 42.35% and click-through rate is 2.09% (MailerLite 2025 Email Marketing Benchmarks). Average email ROI is $36 per $1 spent (Forbes Advisor, 2025). Automated emails achieve 42.1% open rates and 5.4% click rates, generating 320% more revenue than manual campaigns (Genesys Growth, 2025).

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Copy Production
1. Use the framework to draft 2-3 versions per email
2. Write 5+ subject line options and select best 2 for A/B test
3. Read copy aloud to check natural flow
4. Preview on mobile device (60%+ of opens are mobile)
5. Get a second pair of eyes for review

### Testing & Iteration
1. A/B test subject lines on every send
2. Track which frameworks generate highest engagement per audience segment
3. Build a swipe file of winning copy elements
4. Review and update copy templates quarterly

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Low open rate | Subject line doesn't create curiosity or promise value | Test more subject line variations; try different frameworks |
| Opens but no clicks | Body copy doesn't deliver on subject line promise; weak CTA | Strengthen the connection between subject and body; make CTA more specific |
| Clicks but no conversion | Email copy promises more than the landing page delivers | Align email copy with landing page copy; manage expectations |
| High unsubscribe after send | Copy tone or offer mismatched to audience expectations | Review segmentation; adjust tone; ensure content matches signup promise |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Past winners**: ESP → sort campaigns by highest click rate → analyze those subject lines and copy
- **Audience insights**: Survey 20 subscribers on what they value from your emails
- **Competitor emails**: Subscribe to competitor emails → note subject lines and frameworks they use
- **No data**: Describe your product, audience, and campaign goal — Claude writes ready-to-send copy

## Example

**Input**: "Write email copy for a SaaS product's annual pricing promotion. 20% off annual plans for a week. Audience: existing monthly subscribers. Tone: friendly, direct, no hype."

**Output**: 3 subject lines: (1) "Your plan, but 20% less" (direct + benefit), (2) "We did the math so you don't have to" (curiosity), (3) "Quick question about your subscription" (curiosity + personal). Preview text: "Switch to annual and save $[amount] this year." Email body (PAS framework): "You're already getting value from [Product] every day. (acknowledge) But paying monthly means you're spending $[monthly×12] per year. (agitate) Switch to annual this week and pay $[annual price] instead — that's $[savings] back in your budget. (solve) [CTA: Switch to Annual — Save 20%] The math: Monthly = $X/year. Annual = $Y/year. You save $Z. That's [relatable comparison — 'enough for X months of coffee']. This offer expires [date]. After that, it's back to full price. — [Name], [Product] Team. P.S. It takes 30 seconds to switch, and your remaining monthly balance is credited automatically. [CTA: Save 20% Now]"
