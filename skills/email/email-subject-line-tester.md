  Evaluate and improve email subject lines using proven frameworks.
  Use this skill whenever the user mentions email subject lines, email open rates,
  subject line testing, email headlines, A/B testing subject lines, or says things like
  "will this subject line work" or "help me write better email subjects" or "my open
  rates are low." Also trigger for email marketing optimization, email copy review,

# Email Subject Line Tester

Scores email subject lines across 6 dimensions (clarity, urgency, curiosity, personalization, length optimization, spam risk) and generates 5 improved alternatives per line using proven copywriting frameworks.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-45 min setup in Mailchimp / Klaviyo / HubSpot. If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 minutes for setup. Input is 1-10 subject lines. Output is a scored analysis + improved variants.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Score these email subject lines" (direct command)
- "Which subject line will get more opens?" (comparison)
- "My email open rates are dropping, help with subject lines" (problem statement)
- "Write better subject lines for my product launch email" (generation)
- "A/B test ideas for my newsletter subject" (testing)
- "Is this subject line spammy?" (spam check)
- "Make this subject line more compelling" (improvement)
- "I need 5 subject line variants for this email" (variant generation)
- "Review my email subjects before I send" (pre-send check)
- "Help me improve my Mailchimp campaign subject lines" (tool-specific)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subject_lines` | list of strings (1-10) | Subject lines to evaluate | `["Your Q2 Report Is Ready", "Don't Miss This Limited Offer"]` |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No email platform?** Start with Mailchimp's free tier (500 contacts) or use Google Sheets to draft sequences before importing.
- **No subscriber list?** This skill designs the sequence structure. Collect emails via a signup form first, then apply the output.
- **No performance benchmarks?** Industry averages: B2B open rates 20-25%, click rates 2-4%. B2C: open 18-22%, click 2-3%.
- **No segmentation?** Start with one sequence for all subscribers. Segment after you have 500+ contacts.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `industry` | string | `"general"` | Industry for benchmarking |
| `audience` | string | `"general"` | Target recipient description |
| `email_type` | string | `"marketing"` | newsletter, promotional, transactional, drip |
| `brand_tone` | string | `"professional"` | casual, professional, playful, urgent |
| `past_performance` | CSV | `null` | Historical subject line + open rate data |

### Input Validation Rules

1. At least 1 subject line required
2. Maximum 10 subject lines per batch
3. Subject lines should be 1-150 characters (warn outside range)

## Process

1. **Score each subject line** on 6 dimensions (1-10 scale):
   - **Clarity** — Is the value proposition immediately clear?
   - **Urgency** — Does it create time pressure or FOMO?
   - **Curiosity** — Does it create an information gap?
   - **Personalization** — Does it feel addressed to the reader?
   - **Length** — Is it optimized for mobile (30-50 chars ideal) and desktop?
   - **Spam Risk** — Does it use trigger words, ALL CAPS, or excessive punctuation?

2. **Calculate overall score** — Weighted average (clarity 25%, curiosity 20%, personalization 20%, length 15%, urgency 10%, spam risk 10%).

3. **Generate 5 alternatives** per subject line using frameworks:
   - **Curiosity gap:** Create an information gap the reader needs to close
   - **Benefit-driven:** Lead with what the reader gets
   - **Social proof:** Reference numbers, peers, or authority
   - **Question:** Ask a question the reader wants answered
   - **Personalized:** Use "you/your" and specific context

4. **Human checkpoint** — Present scores and top alternatives. Ask: "Do any of these alternatives match your brand voice? Want me to adjust the tone?"

5. **Finalize** — Deliver scored analysis with recommendations.


> **Benchmark Context**: Average email open rate is 42.35% and click-through rate is 2.09% (MailerLite 2025 Email Marketing Benchmarks). Average email ROI is $36 per $1 spent (Forbes Advisor, 2025). Automated emails achieve 42.1% open rates and 5.4% click rates, generating 320% more revenue than manual campaigns (Genesys Growth, 2025).


### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Subject line is just a word | Too vague to score | Ask for full subject line with context |
| Non-English subject line | Language barrier | Note limitation; provide best-effort analysis |
| All lines score poorly | Fundamental messaging issue | Suggest rethinking the email's core value proposition |
| Subject line has merge tags | `{{first_name}}` syntax | Score with and without personalization token |
| Spam score is high | Trigger words detected | Identify specific triggers and suggest alternatives |

## How to Get Your Data

### From Mailchimp

1. Go to Campaigns → All Campaigns
2. Click on a past campaign
3. Note the subject line and open rate
4. Repeat for 5-10 campaigns to build a performance history

### From HubSpot

1. Go to Marketing → Email
2. Sort by open rate
3. Export the list with subject lines and metrics

### From Klaviyo

1. Go to Campaigns tab
2. Sort by open rate
3. Note top-performing vs. low-performing subject lines

## Example

**User prompt:** "Score these subject lines for our SaaS newsletter: 1) 'Your Weekly Product Update' 2) 'You're Missing This Feature (And It's Costing You Hours)' 3) '🚀 BIG NEWS: We Just Launched Something Amazing!!!'"

**Claude output:**

> | Subject Line | Clarity | Urgency | Curiosity | Personal | Length | Spam | Overall |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | "Your Weekly Product Update" | 9 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 9 | 10 | 5.7 |
> | "You're Missing This Feature..." | 7 | 6 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 8 | 7.3 |
> | "🚀 BIG NEWS: We Just Launched..." | 4 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 3.2 |
>
> **Analysis:**
> - Line 1 is clear but boring — zero curiosity or urgency. Reliable but won't drive high opens.
> - Line 2 is the strongest — creates curiosity gap with personal relevance.
> - Line 3 has multiple spam triggers: emoji, ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, vague claim.
>
> **Top 5 alternatives for Line 1:**
> 1. "3 features your team missed this week" (curiosity + specificity)
> 2. "What changed in [Product] this week (2-min read)" (benefit + time commitment)
> 3. "Your team is asking about these updates" (social proof + personalization)
> 4. "This week's update saves you 2 hours/week" (benefit-driven)
> 5. "Quick question about how you use [Feature]" (question + personalization)
