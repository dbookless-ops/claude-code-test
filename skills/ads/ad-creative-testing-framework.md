# Ad Creative Testing Framework

Designs structured creative testing plans with clear hypotheses, controlled variables, statistical rigor, and iteration workflows to systematically improve ad performance.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min building in Google Ads / Meta Ads Manager. If implementing output in ad platforms, add 20-30 min for test setup. Input is current ad performance and test goals. Output is Markdown testing plan with variants.

## User Intent Mapping

- "How do I test my ad creatives?" (methodology)
- "A/B test plan for Facebook ads" (platform-specific)
- "Which headline works best?" (element-specific)
- "Creative testing roadmap for Q2" (planning)
- "Our ads are fatiguing — need fresh creative tests" (refreshing)
- "Test video vs. image ads" (format testing)
- "Hook testing for TikTok ads" (element-specific)
- "How much budget for creative testing?" (budgeting)
- "Test UGC vs. branded content" (style testing)
- "When do I have a winner?" (statistical significance)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Current Ads | Text | Describe or paste your current ad creative (headline, image/video, body, CTA) |
| Platform(s) | Text | Where you're running ads |
| Test Goal | Text | What you want to learn (best hook, best format, best CTA, etc.) |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No current ads?** Claude generates initial test variants from scratch based on your product and audience.
- **No performance data?** Start testing with 2-3 variants from day one. Track CPA and CTR as your baseline metrics.
- **No design resources?** Test copy-only variables first (headlines, CTAs). Copy tests require no design changes.
- **No budget for testing?** Allocate 10-15% of total ad budget. Even $20/day per variant for 7 days yields directional data.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Performance Data | CSV | Current ad metrics (CTR, CPA, ROAS) |
| Target Audience | Text | Who sees these ads |
| Budget | Number | Available for testing |
| Past Test Results | Text | Previous tests and outcomes |
| Brand Guidelines | Text | Constraints on creative direction |

## Process

### Step 1: Testing Hierarchy
Test elements in order of impact:
1. **Concept/Angle** (biggest impact): Different value propositions or emotional appeals
2. **Format** (high impact): Video vs. image vs. carousel vs. UGC
3. **Hook** (high impact): First 3 seconds of video, headline for static
4. **Body Copy** (medium impact): Benefit framing, length, tone
5. **CTA** (medium impact): Button text, urgency, specificity
6. **Visual Details** (lower impact): Colors, layout, font treatment

### Step 2: Hypothesis Formation
For each test, state:
- **Hypothesis**: "Changing [variable] from [A] to [B] will [improve metric] because [reasoning]"
- **Primary metric**: The single metric that determines the winner
- **Secondary metrics**: Supporting metrics to understand why

### Step 3: Variant Design
Rules for controlled testing:
- Change ONE variable at a time (pure A/B) or test complete concepts (concept testing)
- Create 2-4 variants per test (more variants = more budget needed)
- Keep non-test elements identical across variants
- Label variants clearly: Control, Variant A, Variant B

### Step 4: Test Configuration
| Parameter | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Budget per variant | Minimum $50-100/day or 2x target CPA, whichever is higher |
| Duration | 7-14 days minimum |
| Audience | Same audience across all variants |
| Placement | Same placements (or Advantage+ for consistency) |
| Statistical significance | 90-95% confidence before declaring winner |

### Step 5: Analysis & Iteration
- Calculate statistical significance using a significance calculator
- Document results: what won, why (hypothesis confirmed/rejected), learning
- Graduate winners to "control" status
- Design next test based on learnings
- Maintain a testing log for institutional knowledge

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Minimum sample sizes for reliable creative testing: 1,000 impressions for CTR comparisons, 50-100 conversions per variant for CPA comparisons. Below these thresholds, random variance dominates results. A "winner" at 80% confidence may reverse with more data. Wait for 90%+ confidence. Day-of-week and time-of-day effects can skew short tests — always run tests for full weeks.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review test variants for brand consistency, legal compliance, and unintended messaging before launch. Verify that the test audience is large enough to reach significance within your timeline and budget.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Statista 2024 Digital Advertising Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.
## Output Contract

### Deliverable: Markdown Testing Plan

```markdown
# Creative Testing Plan: [Brand] — [Period]

## Test 1: [Name]
- Hypothesis: [statement]
- Variable: [what changes]
- Control: [current creative]
- Variant A: [description]
- Variant B: [description]
- Primary metric: [CPA / CTR / ROAS]
- Budget: $X per variant for Y days
- Minimum sample: [conversions or impressions needed]

## Test 2: [Name]
...

## Testing Calendar
| Week | Test | Variable | Budget | Platform |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Results Log Template
| Test | Control | Variant A | Winner | Confidence | Learning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Creative Testing Rules

```

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Meta Ads Manager (A/B Test)
1. Campaign → A/B Test → Select variable (Creative)
2. Create ad sets with identical targeting and budget
3. Upload different creative per ad set
4. Set test duration (7-14 days recommended)
5. Meta auto-declares winner at significance threshold

### Google Ads (Ad Variations)
1. Campaigns → Experiments → Ad Variations
2. Select campaigns to test
3. Define variation (find and replace headline, description, etc.)
4. Set traffic split and duration
5. Review experiment results in the Experiments tab

### Manual Testing (Any Platform)
1. Create separate ad sets per variant with identical settings
2. Split budget equally
3. Run for 7-14 days without changes
4. Compare metrics in a spreadsheet
5. Use an online significance calculator to determine winner

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| No clear winner | Too similar variants or too little data | Test bolder differences; increase budget or duration |
| Winner in CTR but loser in CPA | Clickbait-y creative that doesn't convert | Optimize for CPA, not CTR; check landing page alignment |
| Results don't replicate | Seasonality or audience shift | Re-test with larger sample; control for time-of-week effects |
| Testing too many things at once | Multivariate without enough budget | Stick to 1 variable per test; run sequentially |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Current ads**: Screenshot or describe your running ads (headline, image, body, CTA)
- **Performance**: Export from ad platform → filter to the ads you want to test
- **No data**: Describe your product and audience — Claude generates initial test variants

## Example

**Input**: "Creative testing plan for our meal kit subscription. Current control: Single image ad with headline 'Healthy Meals Made Easy' and CTA 'Start Cooking'. Platform: Meta. Budget: $2,000/month for testing. Want to test hooks and formats."

**Output**: 3-test roadmap. Test 1 (Week 1-2): Hook testing — Control: 'Healthy Meals Made Easy' vs. Variant A: 'Stop Spending $50/Night on Takeout' vs. Variant B: '15-Minute Dinners Your Kids Will Actually Eat'. Hypothesis: Specific pain-point hooks outperform generic benefit hooks. Budget: $100/day split 3 ways, 14 days. Primary metric: CPA. Test 2 (Week 3-4): Format testing — winning hook in single image vs. UGC-style video vs. carousel (recipe steps). Hypothesis: UGC video converts 2x better than static on Meta Reels. Test 3 (Week 5-6): CTA testing — 'Start Cooking' vs. 'Get 50% Off Your First Box' vs. 'See This Week's Menu'. Hypothesis: Offer-specific CTA converts better than generic. Testing rules: never pause before 7 days, minimum 30 conversions per variant, document all results in testing log.
