Optimizes display and programmatic ad campaigns with placement analysis, viewability improvements, fraud prevention, creative recommendations, and frequency management.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min building in Google Ads / Meta Ads Manager. If implementing output in a platform, add 15-20 min for placement adjustments. Input is display campaign performance CSV. Output is Markdown optimization report.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Our display ads have low CTR" (optimization)
- "Which placements should we exclude?" (placement hygiene)
- "Display campaign audit for our brand" (audit)
- "How to improve display ad viewability" (viewability)
- "Are we getting click fraud?" (fraud detection)
- "Google Display Network best practices" (best practices)
- "Responsive display ads vs. uploaded images" (format guidance)
- "Display ad frequency is too high" (frequency management)
- "Programmatic buying strategy" (strategic)
- "Banner ad specs and sizes" (creative specs)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Campaign Data | CSV | Columns: campaign, placement/site, impressions, clicks, conversions, cost, viewable_impressions (if available) |
| Campaign Goal | Text | Awareness, retargeting, conversions |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No placement report?** Google Ads → Campaigns → Placements → Where Ads Showed. Export this CSV.
- **No viewability data?** Enable Active View metrics in Google Ads. Check after 7 days of data collection.
- **No conversion tracking?** Use view-through conversions and assisted conversions as proxy metrics for display.
- **No historical data?** Claude analyzes your campaign setup and provides best-practice recommendations without performance data.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Placement Exclusion List | CSV | Sites/apps already excluded |
| Creative Assets | Text | Ad sizes and formats currently running |
| Brand Safety Requirements | Text | Content categories to avoid |
| Monthly Budget | Number | For pacing recommendations |
| Industry | Text | For benchmark comparisons |

## Process

### Step 1: Placement Analysis
- Identify top 20 placements by spend and conversions
- Flag placements with high spend but 0 conversions
- Detect suspicious placements (very high CTR, very low viewability)
- Categorize: premium sites, mid-tier, low-quality, apps, YouTube

### Step 2: Viewability Audit
- Overall viewability rate vs. benchmark (70%+ is good, 50% is industry average)
- Viewability by placement (exclude <30% viewable sites)
- Viewability by ad size (300x250 and 728x90 typically most viewable)
- Above-the-fold vs. below-the-fold placement analysis

### Step 3: Fraud & Invalid Traffic Detection
Red flags to investigate:
- CTR > 3% on display (unusually high, possible bot clicks)
- Bounce rate > 95% from specific placements
- 0-second sessions from specific sources
- Placements with names containing random strings or mobile app IDs you don't recognize
- Geographic anomalies (clicks from unexpected countries)

### Step 4: Creative Optimization
- Responsive display ads: test 5+ headlines, 5+ descriptions, 3+ images
- Top-performing ad sizes: 300x250, 336x280, 728x90, 160x600, 300x600
- Animated vs. static performance comparison
- CTA button best practices (contrasting color, action verb)

### Step 5: Frequency & Reach Management
- Frequency cap recommendations (3-5/day for awareness, 1-2/day for retargeting)
- Reach vs. frequency trade-off analysis
- Audience fatigue detection (declining CTR over time at same frequency)

### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Display ad metrics are noisier than search. CTR benchmarks (0.1-0.5%) mean you need 10,000+ impressions per placement for reliable performance data. View-through conversions are modeled and should be weighted lower than click-through conversions. Invalid traffic detection is directional — use Google's IVT reports and third-party verification for definitive fraud analysis.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review placement exclusion list before applying — some legitimate sites may appear as poor performers due to attribution gaps. Verify brand safety categories align with your policies. Check that creative meets platform specs before uploading.

> **Benchmark Context**: Average Google Ads CTR is 6.66% for search and 0.46% for display (WordStream 2025 Industry Benchmarks). Average Meta Ads CTR ranges from 1.5-1.7% across industries (Meta 2025 Advertising Benchmarks).

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Google Ads (GDN)
1. Placements → Where Ads Showed → download performance
2. Add exclusions: Placements → Exclusions → paste site list
3. Set frequency caps: Campaign settings → Additional settings → Frequency capping
4. Create responsive display ads: Ads → New Ad → Responsive Display Ad
5. Enable Active View metrics in Columns → Customize

### DV360 / Programmatic
1. Review Inventory Quality reports for viewability and fraud
2. Apply pre-bid viewability targeting (target 70%+ viewable)
3. Enable IAS or DoubleVerify for third-party verification
4. Set up PMPs (Private Marketplace deals) for premium inventory

### Brand Safety (Any Platform)
1. Exclude sensitive content categories in campaign settings
2. Upload site exclusion list from the optimization report
3. Consider third-party brand safety tools (IAS, DoubleVerify, Zefr)
4. Review quarterly and update exclusion lists

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Excluded too many placements | Over-aggressive exclusions killed reach | Restore placements with 500+ impressions; re-evaluate after 14 days |
| Low viewability persists | Wrong ad sizes or poor placement quality | Switch to high-viewability sizes (300x250, 300x600); target above-the-fold |
| Click fraud continues | Sophisticated bot traffic | Enable click fraud protection; report to Google; consider IVT vendor |
| Creative fatigue | Same ads for 30+ days | Refresh creative monthly; test 3-5 variants |

## How to Get Your Data

- **Google Ads**: Campaigns → Placements → Where Ads Showed → Export CSV
- **DV360**: Insights → Create Report → include placement and viewability metrics
- **No data**: Describe your campaign setup — Claude provides best-practice recommendations

## Example

**Input**: CSV with 30-day GDN placement report. 500 placements, $8,000 spend, 45 conversions, $178 CPA (target: $100).

**Output**: Top 10 placements drive 70% of conversions at $85 CPA. Bottom 200 placements spent $2,400 with 0 conversions — exclude immediately (saves 30% of budget). 15 placements flagged for fraud indicators: CTR >5% with 0 conversions and 100% bounce rate. Viewability: 48% overall (below 50% benchmark) — exclude 30 sites with <20% viewability. Creative: only running 2 static 300x250 ads — recommend switching to Responsive Display Ads and adding 728x90 and 300x600 sizes. Frequency: averaging 8.2 impressions/user/day (too high) — set cap at 3/day. Projected impact: CPA reduction from $178 to $95-110 by cutting waste placements and capping frequency.
