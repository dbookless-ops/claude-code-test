# Google Ads Campaign Builder

Structure a complete Google Ads search campaign from scratch: campaign settings, ad group hierarchy, keyword lists with match types, negative keywords, responsive search ad copy, bid strategy, and budget recommendations.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min building in Google Ads / Meta Ads Manager.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is business context + target keywords. Output is a complete campaign structure in XLSX ready for Google Ads Editor import.

## User Intent Mapping

Trigger when the user says:

- "Build a Google Ads campaign for my product" (direct request)
- "Structure my PPC campaign" (campaign architecture)
- "Set up search ads for [keyword]" (keyword-specific)
- "Create ad groups for my Google Ads" (structural)
- "What match types should I use?" (strategy question)
- "Write RSA headlines and descriptions" (ad copy)
- "Plan my Google Ads account structure" (account planning)
- "I'm launching Google Ads for the first time" (new advertiser)
- "Organize my keywords into ad groups" (grouping)
- "Build a campaign with negative keywords" (comprehensive)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `product_or_service` | string | What you're advertising |
| `target_keywords` | list or CSV | Keywords to target (or seed keywords to expand) |
| `landing_page_url` | string | Where ads will send traffic |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No product description?** Write 2-3 sentences about what you sell, who buys it, and why they choose you over alternatives.
- **No target audience?** Start with your last 10 customers — what do they have in common? Use that as your audience.
- **No performance data?** That's fine — this skill generates fresh copy from scratch. Performance data only helps with optimization iterations.
- **No competitor info?** Search your primary keyword on Google — the ads that appear are your competitors. Note their headlines.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `monthly_budget` | float | Not set | Budget in USD |
| `target_location` | string | United States | Geographic targeting |
| `campaign_goal` | string | Conversions | Conversions / Leads / Traffic / Brand awareness |
| `competitors` | list | null | Competitor names (for conquest campaigns) |
| `existing_keywords` | CSV | null | Current keyword data with performance |
| `industry` | string | Inferred | Industry vertical for benchmarks |
| `bid_strategy` | string | Maximize conversions | Preferred bidding approach |
| `brand_terms` | list | null | Brand keywords (separate campaign recommended) |

### Sample Input

```
Product: Project management SaaS ($29-99/month plans)
Target keywords: project management software, PM tools, task management app, team collaboration software
Landing page: https://example.com/free-trial
Monthly budget: $5,000
Target location: US + Canada
Goal: Free trial sign-ups
```

### Input Validation Rules

1. At least 5 seed keywords recommended (warn if fewer)
2. Landing page URL required — campaign performance depends on page quality
3. If budget provided, calculate estimated click volume and keyword feasibility
4. Flag any keywords that are too broad for the budget (e.g., single-word terms with $50+ CPCs)

## Process

1. **Expand keywords** — From seed keywords, generate 30-80 related keywords organized by theme. Group by:
   - Intent (commercial, informational, navigational)
   - Funnel stage (awareness, consideration, decision)
   - Specificity (head terms, mid-tail, long-tail)

2. **Structure ad groups** — Create 5-10 ad groups, each containing 5-15 tightly themed keywords:
   - SKAG alternative: Themed Ad Groups (TAGs) with 5-15 related keywords
   - Each ad group shares a common intent and can be served by the same ad copy
   - Name convention: `[Campaign]_[Theme]_[Intent]`

3. **Assign match types** — For each keyword:
   - **Exact match** `[keyword]` — High-intent, high-volume keywords
   - **Phrase match** `"keyword"` — Mid-volume, capturing variations
   - **Broad match** `keyword` — Only with smart bidding and sufficient conversion data
   - Recommend starting with exact + phrase, adding broad after 30+ conversions

4. **Build negative keyword list** — Generate 20-50 negatives:
   - Universal negatives (free, cheap, jobs, salary, how to, DIY, reddit, review)
   - Industry-specific negatives
   - Cross-ad-group negatives (prevent internal competition)

5. **Write RSA ad copy** — Per ad group:
   - 15 headlines (30 char limit each): mix keyword-containing, benefit-driven, CTA, social proof
   - 4 descriptions (90 char limit each): value prop, features, CTA, trust signal
   - Pin headline 1 (keyword) and headline 2 (benefit) for message consistency
   - Ensure at least 3 unique headlines contain the target keyword

6. **Set campaign parameters:**
   - Bid strategy recommendation based on goal and budget
   - Budget allocation across ad groups (proportional to opportunity)
   - Ad schedule (if data suggests optimal times)
   - Device targeting recommendations
   - Ad extensions: sitelinks (4), callouts (4), structured snippets, call extension

7. **Human checkpoint** — Present campaign structure overview. Ask: "Does this ad group structure make sense? Any keywords to add/remove?"

8. **Generate structured output** — Data tables in Markdown with step-by-step instructions to paste into Google Sheets or Excel for formatting.


> **Benchmark Context**: Average Google Ads CTR is 6.66% for search and 0.46% for display (WordStream 2025 Industry Benchmarks). Average Meta Ads CTR ranges from 1.5-1.7% across industries (Meta 2025 Advertising Benchmarks).


### Confidence & Sample Size.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Keywords too broad | Single-word terms | Suggest long-tail variations; set as phrase/exact only |
| Budget too low for keywords | High-CPC industry | Focus on long-tail, lower-competition keywords |
| Too few keywords (<5) | Limited input | Expand from seed keywords using related terms |
| Competing with own organic rankings | Brand terms bidding | Recommend separate brand vs non-brand campaigns |
| No conversion tracking | New account | Strongly recommend setting up conversion tracking before spending |
| Very niche industry | Few keywords exist | Focus on broader awareness campaigns; suggest Display/YouTube |
