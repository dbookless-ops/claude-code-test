  "answer these vendor questions", "fill out this security questionnaire", "proposal response",

# RFP Response Builder

Generates structured, professional responses to RFP (Request for Proposal) and RFI (Request for Information) questions based on product knowledge, past answers, and best practices. Produces a ready-to-submit response document.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min customizing for your prospect.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is RFP questions + product context. Output is a Markdown response document. No system access needed.

## User Intent Mapping

This skill should trigger when the user says things like:

- "Help me respond to this RFP" (direct request)
- "Answer these vendor evaluation questions" (specific task)
- "We got an RFI — draft responses" (document type)
- "Fill out this security questionnaire for the prospect" (compliance)
- "Draft answers for this procurement process" (procurement)
- "Our proposal is due Friday — help me write it" (deadline pressure)
- "Respond to these technical requirements" (specific section)
- "Here are 50 questions from the prospect" (batch processing)
- "Make our RFP responses sound more compelling" (quality improvement)
- "Customize our standard RFP answers for healthcare" (industry tailoring)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| RFP Questions | Text | The questions to answer (pasted from the RFP document) |
| Product/Company Info | Text | What you do, key capabilities, differentiators |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No CRM data?** Export your email contacts, LinkedIn connections, or even a list of companies you've spoken to in a spreadsheet.
- **No deal outcome data?** Start with win/loss status on your last 20 deals. Even rough data is better than none.
- **No content library?** List every PDF, deck, and one-pager your sales team uses — even a 10-item list is a valid starting point.
- **No engagement metrics?** Track which content sales reps send in emails for the next 2 weeks. Manual tracking beats no tracking.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Past RFP Answers | Text | Previously approved responses to reuse/adapt |
| Industry | Text | Prospect's industry (for tailored language) |
| Prospect Name | Text | For personalization |
| Compliance Certs | Text | SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR certifications |
| Competitor Context | Text | Who you're competing against in this RFP |
| Win Themes | Text | Key differentiators to emphasize throughout |
| Word/Character Limits | Text | Any length constraints per answer |

## Process

### Step 1: Question Categorization
Classify each question into categories:
- **Company Overview**: History, financials, references, team
- **Technical Capabilities**: Features, architecture, integrations, scalability
- **Security & Compliance**: Data handling, certifications, incident response
- **Implementation**: Timeline, methodology, training, support
- **Pricing & Commercial**: Licensing, SLAs, contract terms
- **Differentiators**: Innovation, roadmap, unique capabilities

### Step 2: Response Drafting
For each question, draft a response following RFP best practices:
- **Lead with "yes"**: Start with a clear affirmative when possible
- **Be specific**: Replace vague claims with concrete details
- **Quantify**: Use numbers (99.9% uptime, 500+ integrations, 48-hour response)
- **Differentiate**: Weave in win themes without being heavy-handed
- **Evidence**: Include customer examples, certifications, metrics
- **Compliant**: Directly address what was asked before adding context

### Step 3: Consistency Check
Across all answers, ensure:
- Terminology is consistent (don't call the same feature by 3 names)
- Claims don't contradict each other
- Tone is professional and confident without overpromising
- Company name and product names are used consistently

### Step 4: Compliance Flagging
Flag any questions where:
- The honest answer is "no" or "partial" — draft diplomatically
- The answer requires legal or security team review
- A claim needs verification before submission
- The question reveals a requirement you can't meet

### Step 5: Executive Summary
Draft a 1-page executive summary for the RFP response:
- Why your company is the right choice
- Top 3 differentiators for this specific prospect
- Relevant experience and references
- Commitment statement


### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review all responses before submission. Verify technical accuracy, confirm pricing with finance, ensure legal has approved compliance claims. Never submit without internal review.


> **Benchmark Context**: See Gartner 2024 B2B Buying Journey Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

2. Structure columns per the output schema
3. Use Data → Filter Views for dynamic sorting
4. Share with team via link for collaboration

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Insufficient product knowledge | User provided limited product info | Answer what's possible, flag gaps, ask for product documentation |
| Highly technical questions | Deep technical specs beyond available info | Draft framework response, flag as "needs engineering input" |
| Contradictory requirements | RFP asks for conflicting capabilities | Note the contradiction, answer each part honestly |
| Massive RFP (200+ questions) | Too many for single session | Batch into sections, handle one category per session |

## How to Get Your Data

- **RFP document**: Copy-paste the questions section (or the entire document)
- **Past RFP responses**: Check your sales enablement folder, Google Drive, or Confluence
- **Product documentation**: Feature lists, security documentation, architecture guides
- **Certifications**: SOC 2 report, ISO certificates, compliance documentation
- **Customer references**: Approved reference list with use cases

## Example

**Input**: 25-question RFP from a healthcare company evaluating marketing analytics platforms. Product: SaaS analytics platform with HIPAA compliance. Competitor: Looker.

**Output**: Full response document with executive summary emphasizing healthcare-specific compliance (HIPAA BAA, SOC 2 Type II), 25 answers categorized into 5 sections, 3 flagged items (pricing needs finance sign-off, custom integration timeline needs engineering estimate, reference customer needs permission). Win themes woven throughout: purpose-built for marketing teams (vs. Looker's general-purpose approach), HIPAA-compliant by default, 2-week implementation vs. typical 6-8 weeks.
