## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Business Description | Text | What you sell and to whom |
| Customer Data | Text/CSV | Any data about current customers |
| Business Goals | Text | What you want personas to inform |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No customer data?** Claude builds hypothesis personas from your business model, industry patterns, and competitive research — then recommends validation methods.
- **Small customer base?** Claude works with qualitative data (interviews, support tickets, sales conversations) to build personas from 10-20 data points.
- **Only demographics, no psychographics?** Claude enriches demographic data with behavioral and motivational patterns typical for your market.
- **Not sure how many personas?** Claude recommends 3-5 personas maximum, prioritized by revenue potential and marketing reach.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Analytics Data | CSV | Website demographics, behavior flows |
| CRM Data | Text | Customer attributes, deal sizes, win rates |
| Survey Results | CSV | Customer research survey responses |
| Interview Notes | Text | Qualitative customer insights |
| Social Data | Text | Audience demographics from social platforms |

## Process

### Step 1: Data Collection Matrix
| Data Source | What It Tells You | Persona Element |
|---|---|---|
| CRM | Who buys, deal size, sales cycle | Demographics, firmographics |
| Analytics | How they find you, what content they consume | Channels, interests |
| Surveys | Why they buy, what they value | Motivations, pain points |
| Interviews | Decision process, objections, language | Buying journey, messaging |
| Support tickets | What problems they have | Pain points, feature needs |
| Social media | How they describe themselves, what they share | Psychographics, language |
| Sales team | Common objections, decision-makers, competitors considered | Buying criteria |

### Step 2: Persona Components
| Component | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Demographics | Age, role, company size, industry | CRM, analytics |
| Goals | What they're trying to achieve | Interviews, surveys |
| Pain points | Problems they need solved | Support, sales, surveys |
| Buying triggers | What causes them to look for a solution | Sales, interviews |
| Decision criteria | How they evaluate solutions | Win/loss, interviews |
| Information sources | Where they learn and research | Analytics, surveys |
| Objections | What holds them back from buying | Sales, win/loss |
| Success metrics | How they measure whether the solution worked | Interviews, support |

### Step 3: Persona Prioritization
| Criteria | Weight | How to Assess |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue potential | 30% | Average deal size × addressable market |
| Acquisition cost | 20% | Marketing spend to acquire this persona |
| Retention/LTV | 20% | Churn rate and expansion potential |
| Product fit | 15% | How well your product serves this persona |
| Growth rate | 15% | Is this segment growing or shrinking? |

### Step 4: B2B Buying Committee Mapping
| Role | Involvement | Priorities | Content Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Champion | Day-to-day user, drives evaluation | Ease of use, features | Product demos, case studies |
| Decision-maker | Signs off on budget | ROI, strategic fit | Executive summaries, ROI calculators |
| Influencer | Provides technical evaluation | Integration, security | Technical docs, architecture guides |
| Gatekeeper | Controls information flow | Compliance, vendor requirements | Security questionnaires, compliance docs |
| End user | Uses the product daily | Usability, workflow | Tutorial content, training materials |

### Step 5: Jobs-to-Be-Done Layer
Per persona:
- **Functional job**: What task they need to accomplish
- **Emotional job**: How they want to feel
- **Social job**: How they want to be perceived
- **Hiring criteria**: What would make them "hire" your product
- **Firing criteria**: What would make them "fire" your product

### Step 6: Persona Activation
| Application | How Persona Informs |
|---|---|
| Content strategy | Topics, formats, channels per persona |
| Ad targeting | Audience parameters, messaging angles |
| Email marketing | Segmentation, messaging, send cadence |
| Sales enablement | Talking points, objection handling per persona |
| Product development | Feature prioritization by persona value |
| Website | Page structure, messaging hierarchy |

### Confidence & Sample Size

> **Confidence Note**: Personas based on fewer than 10 data points (interviews + data) are hypotheses, not validated personas. Aim for 15-20 customer interviews per persona for reliable qualitative patterns. Quantitative validation requires 200+ data points per persona. Personas should be updated annually — markets and customers change. The biggest persona mistake is creating too many (5+ active personas dilute marketing focus). Avoid "aspirational" personas (who you wish your customers were) — base personas on actual buyers.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Validate persona profiles with sales team and customer success before using for targeting. Ensure personas represent actual customer patterns, not internal assumptions or wishful thinking. Test persona-based messaging with real customers before full rollout.

> **Benchmark Context**: See Gartner 2024 Marketing Technology Survey for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

5. Report on pipeline and revenue by persona

### Marketing Automation

2. Design nurture sequences per persona
3. Set up dynamic content rules by persona

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Personas sit in a deck unused | No activation plan; too abstract | Make personas actionable with specific marketing applications |
| Too many personas | Tried to cover every customer type | Consolidate to 3-4 based on revenue and marketing priority |
| Personas don't match reality | Based on assumptions, not data | Validate with customer interviews and quantitative data |
| Team doesn't adopt personas | Personas feel like marketing fluff | Include sales and product teams in persona development |

## How to Get Your Data

- **CRM data**: Export customer list with demographics, deal size, industry, role
- **Analytics**: GA4 → Reports → Demographics → Overview; Acquisition → Traffic
- **Surveys**: Send 5-question persona validation survey to customer list
- **Interviews**: Schedule 30-minute calls with 5 customers per suspected persona
- **No data**: Describe your product and who you think buys it — Claude creates hypothesis personas

## Example

**Input**: "Build buyer personas for our HR tech SaaS. We sell to mid-market companies (100-1,000 employees). Current customers: 60% HR directors, 25% CHROs, 15% People Ops managers. Average deal: $15K/year. Main use case: employee onboarding and offboarding."

**Output**: 3 personas recommended: (1) "Director Dana" (HR Director, 100-500 employees) — 60% of revenue, primary persona. Goal: streamline onboarding to reduce time-to-productivity. Pain: manual processes, compliance risk, scaling hiring. Trigger: new leadership demanding HR efficiency OR compliance audit. Channels: LinkedIn, HR conferences, peer recommendations. Content: ROI calculators, compliance guides, "how we do it" case studies. Messaging: "Onboard in days, not weeks." (2) "CHRO Chris" (CHRO, 500-1,000 employees) — 25% of revenue, highest deal size ($25K avg). Goal: strategic HR transformation. Pain: too much time on operations, not enough on strategy. Trigger: board pressure to modernize HR. Channels: executive events, analyst reports, CHRO communities. Content: strategic whitepapers, analyst endorsements, executive case studies. Messaging: "Automate operations so you can focus on strategy." (3) "People Ops Pat" (People Ops Manager, 100-500 employees) — 15% of revenue, strongest champion. Goal: not get burned by missed steps in onboarding/offboarding. Pain: checklist chaos, no single source of truth. Trigger: a bad offboarding incident. Channels: People Ops communities (Slack, Reddit), product-led growth (free trial). Content: templates, checklists, product tutorials. Messaging: "Never miss a step." Activation: focus 60% of content on Persona 1, use Persona 3 as product-led entry point, create executive-level content for Persona 2 during enterprise deals.
