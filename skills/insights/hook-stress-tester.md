# Hook Stress Tester

Evaluate marketing headlines and hooks on a 10-point scale across 6 dimensions. For each input headline, provide a scored analysis and generate 10 improved alternatives with rationale.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min synthesizing into your strategy deck.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is 1-10 headlines. Output is scored analysis + 10 improved variants per headline.

## User Intent Mapping

Trigger when the user says:

- "Rate this headline" (scoring request)
- "Stress test these hooks" (evaluation)
- "Which of these headlines is strongest?" (comparison)
- "Improve my landing page headline" (optimization)
- "Score my ad headlines" (ad copy review)
- "Is this subject line compelling enough?" (email)
- "Generate better headline alternatives" (improvement)
- "My click-through rate is low — is it the headline?" (diagnostic)
- "Write me 10 headline options for this topic" (generation)
- "Evaluate these hooks for a LinkedIn post" (social media)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `headlines` | list of strings | 1-10 headlines to evaluate |
| `context` | string | What the headline is for (ad, blog, email, landing page, social) |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No customer interviews?** Use support tickets, sales call notes, or online reviews as proxy customer voice data.
- **No survey data?** Send a 5-question NPS-style survey to your customer base. 30+ responses is enough for initial patterns.
- **No competitor content?** Search your primary keywords and screenshot the top 10 results. That's your competitive landscape.
- **No win/loss data?** Ask your sales team to recall their last 5 won and 5 lost deals. Verbal notes work fine as input.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target_audience` | string | Who should click/read |
| `product_or_topic` | string | What's being promoted |
| `platform` | string | Where it will appear (Google Ads, LinkedIn, email, blog) |
| `character_limit` | integer | Max characters (e.g., 30 for Google Ads headlines) |
| `tone` | string | Desired voice (professional, edgy, playful, authoritative) |
| `competitors` | list | Competitor headlines to differentiate from |

### Sample Input

```
Headlines to test:
1. "The Ultimate Guide to Project Management"
2. "Why 67% of Projects Fail (And How to Fix Yours)"
3. "Project Management Software for Modern Teams"

Context: Blog post titles for a project management SaaS
Target audience: Team leads and project managers
```

### Input Validation Rules

1. At least 1 headline required
2. Maximum 10 headlines per batch (more than that = diminishing analysis quality)
3. Context helps calibrate scoring (ad headline vs blog title have different standards)
4. If platform specified, apply platform-specific constraints

## Process

1. **Score each headline across 6 dimensions (1-10 each):**

   **a. Curiosity Gap (weight: 20%)**
   - Does it create a question in the reader's mind?
   - Does it tease information without giving everything away?
   - 10 = irresistible urge to click; 1 = no curiosity generated

   **b. Specificity (weight: 20%)**
   - Does it use concrete numbers, names, or details?
   - "67% of projects" > "many projects" > "projects"
   - 10 = precise, data-driven claims; 1 = vague generalities

   **c. Emotional Resonance (weight: 20%)**
   - Does it trigger an emotional response (fear, desire, frustration, hope)?
   - Does it connect to a felt pain or aspiration?
   - 10 = strong emotional pull; 1 = emotionally flat

   **d. Novelty (weight: 15%)**
   - Does it feel fresh and unexpected?
   - Would this stand out in a feed of similar content?
   - 10 = never seen anything like it; 1 = cliché/overused format

   **e. Clarity (weight: 15%)**
   - Is the value proposition immediately clear?
   - Can the reader understand what they'll get in <2 seconds?
   - 10 = crystal clear benefit; 1 = confusing or ambiguous

   **f. Urgency/Relevance (weight: 10%)**
   - Does it feel timely or personally relevant?
   - Is there a reason to click NOW vs. later?
   - 10 = must read immediately; 1 = can read anytime/never

2. **Calculate overall score** — Weighted average (1-10 scale).

3. **Rank all submitted headlines** from strongest to weakest.

4. **For each headline, identify:**
   - Strongest dimension (what's working)
   - Weakest dimension (what's holding it back)
   - Specific fix for the weakest dimension

5. **Generate 10 improved alternatives** per headline:
   - 2 curiosity-optimized variants
   - 2 specificity-optimized variants
   - 2 emotional variants
   - 2 novelty/contrarian variants
   - 1 clarity-optimized variant
   - 1 urgency-optimized variant
   - Each with a brief rationale explaining the technique used

6. **Apply platform constraints** if specified:
   - Google Ads: ≤30 characters per headline
   - Email subject: ≤50 characters optimal
   - LinkedIn: ≤150 characters for preview
   - Blog: ≤60 characters for SERP display

7. **Human checkpoint** — Present the scores. Ask: "Do the scores feel right? Want me to go deeper on any specific headline?"


> **Benchmark Context**: See McKinsey 2024 State of AI Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

# Hook Stress Test Results
Headlines tested: [N]
Context: [platform/use case]

## Ranking
| Rank | Headline | Overall Score |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Why 67% of Projects Fail (And How to Fix Yours)" | 7.8/10 |
| 2 | "Project Management Software for Modern Teams" | 4.2/10 |
| 3 | "The Ultimate Guide to Project Management" | 3.5/10 |

## Detailed Analysis

### Headline 1: "Why 67% of Projects Fail (And How to Fix Yours)"
**Overall: 7.8/10**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Curiosity | 8/10 | "Why" + parenthetical creates double curiosity |
| Specificity | 9/10 | "67%" is concrete and credible |
| Emotion | 7/10 | "Fail" triggers fear; "fix yours" offers hope |
| Novelty | 6/10 | "Why X% fail" is a proven but common format |
| Clarity | 8/10 | Clear promise: diagnosis + solution |
| Urgency | 7/10 | "Yours" makes it personal and immediate |

**Strongest:** Specificity (the 67% stat anchors credibility)
**Weakest:** Novelty (format is familiar — could feel predictable)
**Quick fix:** Make the format less expected while keeping the data

### Improved Variants:
1. **Curiosity:** "The Invisible Mistake Behind 67% of Failed Projects" (what mistake? must click)
2. **Curiosity:** "67% of Projects Fail for the Same Reason. Here's What No One Tells You." (insider knowledge tease)
3. **Specificity:** "67% of Projects Fail Before Week 3. Here's the Fix That Takes 10 Minutes." (more numbers)
4. **Specificity:** "We Analyzed 1,000 Failed Projects. 67% Share This One Mistake." (adds methodology)
5. **Emotional:** "That Sinking Feeling When Your Project Is Off Track? 67% of Teams Know It." (visceral)
6. **Emotional:** "Stop Watching Your Projects Slowly Fail. 67% Do — You Don't Have To." (empowerment)
7. **Novelty:** "67% of Projects Fail. The Other 33% Do This Differently." (flip the frame)
8. **Novelty:** "Project Failure Is a $1M Problem. Most Teams Treat It as a $0 One." (money frame)
9. **Clarity:** "How to Be in the 33% of Projects That Succeed (3-Step Framework)" (clear promise)
10. **Urgency:** "Your Current Project Has a 67% Chance of Failing. Fix It This Week." (immediate threat)

5. Share with stakeholders

### Notion
1. Create a new page
2. Paste the Markdown output directly
3. Convert tables to Notion databases for filtering/sorting
4. Add to your team's research hub

### Presentation (for Stakeholders)

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Only 1 headline | No comparison possible | Still score and generate alternatives; note comparison is more useful |
| No context | Don't know the platform/audience | Score generically; note that platform-specific analysis would be better |
| Headlines are for different topics | Can't compare fairly | Score each independently; don't rank against each other |
| Character limit too restrictive | Google Ads 30-char headlines | Focus variants on brevity techniques; some dimensions less relevant |
| Headlines are already excellent (>8/10) | High-quality input | Focus improvements on incremental gains; suggest A/B test pairings |
