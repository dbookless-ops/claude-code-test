### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No customer interviews?** Use support tickets, sales call notes, or online reviews as proxy customer voice data.
- **No survey data?** Send a 5-question NPS-style survey to your customer base. 30+ responses is enough for initial patterns.
- **No competitor content?** Search your primary keywords and screenshot the top 10 results. That's your competitive landscape.
- **No win/loss data?** Ask your sales team to recall their last 5 won and 5 lost deals. Verbal notes work fine as input.

## Process

1. **Subreddit Selection & Validation**
   - Confirm 2-5 target subreddits are active and relevant
   - Validate subreddit has healthy discussion (1000+ members, regular posts)
   - Check subreddit rules allow product discussion (not banned)
   - Assess audience demographic fit with target customer
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Approve target subreddits and rationale

2. **Keyword & Query Strategy**
   - Create search queries combining keywords (e.g., "marketing automation" OR "email campaigns")
   - Set time filter: Last 90 days
   - Plan competitor-specific searches (optional)
   - Identify emotion-focused searches ("frustrated with X", "love Y")
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Review keyword search strategy

3. **Reddit Web Search & Thread Collection**
   - Conduct web searches for each subreddit + keyword combination
   - Collect 40-60 relevant Reddit threads/discussions
   - Prioritize threads with 50+ comments (signal of active discussion)
   - Filter for human discussion (exclude bots, promotions)
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Confirm thread sample size and relevance

4. **Content Analysis & Extraction**
   - Extract verbatim quotes (10-15 per insight category)
   - Identify pain points: frustrations, complaints, blockers mentioned
   - Identify buying triggers: moments of intent, decision drivers
   - Extract emotional language: metaphors, intensity, authentic phrasing
   - Flag objections: concerns, hesitations, deal-breakers
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Validate quote accuracy and categorization

5. **Theme Identification & Clustering**
   - Group pain points into 4-6 dominant themes
   - Rank themes by frequency and intensity
   - Identify buying triggers associated with each pain point
   - Map objections to buying journey stage (awareness/consideration/decision)
   - Note underserved needs (mentioned but no solution discussed)
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Review theme clustering and accuracy

6. **Sentiment & Language Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyze emotional tone: frustration, enthusiasm, skepticism
   - Identify resonant language and metaphors used by customers
   - Extract decision-making language ("We chose X because...")
   - Map sentiment across competitor mentions (if applicable)
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Validate emotional analysis authenticity

7. **Messaging Opportunity Mapping**
   - Connect each pain point to potential value prop
   - Extract messaging angles from customer language
   - Identify objection rebuttals from threads where solved
   - Suggest content topics based on FAQ themes
   - Note content format preferences (threads, guides, comparisons)
   - **Human Checkpoint:** Review messaging recommendations

8. **Structured Output Generation**
   - Compile insights into Markdown tables (ready to paste into Google Sheets or Excel)
   - Create theme summary
   - Generate verbatim quote library
   - Output actionable recommendations


> **Benchmark Context**: See McKinsey 2024 State of AI Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Failure Modes

| Scenario | Symptom | Resolution |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Insufficient data | <20 threads found after searching | Expand keywords; broaden subreddits (add r/business, r/EntrepreneurRidiculousness); note limitation in report; offer 60-day analysis |
| Subreddit too niche | Subreddit has <500 members or <1 post/day | Replace with related subreddit; ask user for alternative communities; note audience limitation |
| No relevant discussions | Keywords return zero results in target subreddits | Suggest alternative keywords; check subreddit rules (may ban product discussion); recommend 1-2 new subreddits |
| Quotes seem inauthentic | Extracted quotes sound promotional or fake | Flag for manual review; remove bot-detected posts; re-verify quote accuracy via Reddit URL |
| Competitor visibility | Target competitor not mentioned in subreddits | Note as "competitor not discussed in Reddit" — may indicate low awareness; suggest indirect comparison messaging |
| Trend too recent | Data shows emerging trend but insufficient evidence | Flag as "emerging insight" with lower confidence; recommend 30-day re-analysis; note sample size limitation |
