# Ad Copy Generator

Generates 10+ ad copy variants per platform (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads), organized by persuasion angle and respecting each platform's character limits. Includes A/B testing recommendations.

## Granularity Check

> **Time**: ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~30-60 min building in Google Ads / Meta Ads Manager. If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 minutes for setup. Input is product/audience description. Output is Markdown with organized ad variants.

## User Intent Mapping

- "Write Google Ads headlines for my product" (platform-specific)
- "I need Facebook ad copy for a product launch" (platform-specific)
- "Generate ad variants for A/B testing" (testing)
- "Help me write LinkedIn sponsored content" (platform-specific)
- "Create responsive search ad headlines and descriptions" (Google-specific)
- "I need ad copy for my landing page campaign" (campaign-specific)
- "Write ads that highlight our free trial" (offer-specific)
- "Generate copy for different ad angles" (strategic)
- "My ads aren't converting, help me rewrite them" (problem statement)
- "I need 15 headline options for Google Ads" (quantity-specific)

## Input Contract

### Required Input

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `product_description` | string | What you're selling | `"TaskFlow: project management for remote teams, $12/mo"` |
| `target_audience` | string | Who you're targeting | `"Startup CTOs managing 5-25 person teams"` |
| `platform` | string | Ad platform(s) | `"google"`, `"meta"`, `"linkedin"`, or `"all"` |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No product description?** Write 2-3 sentences about what you sell, who buys it, and why they choose you over alternatives.
- **No target audience?** Start with your last 10 customers — what do they have in common? Use that as your audience.
- **No performance data?** That's fine — this skill generates fresh copy from scratch. Performance data only helps with optimization iterations.
- **No competitor info?** Search your primary keyword on Google — the ads that appear are your competitors. Note their headlines.

### Optional Input

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `usps` | list of strings | extracted from product_description | Unique selling points |
| `campaign_objective` | string | `"conversions"` | awareness, traffic, conversions, leads |
| `competitor_names` | list | `[]` | Competitors to differentiate from |
| `tone` | string | `"professional"` | professional, casual, urgent, playful |
| `offer` | string | `""` | Specific offer: "free trial", "20% off", etc. |
| `landing_page_url` | string | `""` | For display URL suggestions |

### Input Validation Rules

1. `product_description` must be at least 20 characters
2. `platform` must be one of: google, meta, linkedin, all
3. `target_audience` must not be empty

## Process

1. **Analyze product** — Extract key benefits, features, and differentiators from the product description and USPs.

2. **Apply platform constraints:**

   **Google Ads (Responsive Search Ads):**
   - Headlines: 30 characters max, need 15 variants
   - Descriptions: 90 characters max, need 4 variants
   - Display path: 15 chars per segment

   **Meta Ads:**
   - Primary text: 125 characters (visible without "See more")
   - Headline: 40 characters
   - Description: 30 characters
   - Link description: 30 characters

   **LinkedIn Ads:**
   - Introductory text: 150 characters (visible without truncation)
   - Headline: 70 characters
   - Description: 100 characters

3. **Generate by angle** — Create variants for each persuasion angle:
   - **Benefit-driven:** Lead with the outcome ("Save 5 hours/week")
   - **Fear/pain point:** Address what they'll lose ("Stop losing projects to chaos")
   - **Social proof:** Numbers and authority ("Join 10,000+ teams")
   - **Urgency:** Time pressure ("Free trial ends Friday")
   - **Curiosity:** Information gap ("The PM tool CTOs are switching to")

4. **Human checkpoint** — Present top 5 variants per platform. Ask: "Which angles resonate most with your brand? Should I lean into any specific direction?"

5. **Finalize** — Deliver complete variant set with A/B testing recommendations.


> **Benchmark Context**: Average Google Ads CTR is 6.66% for search and 0.46% for display (WordStream 2025 Industry Benchmarks). Average Meta Ads CTR ranges from 1.5-1.7% across industries (Meta 2025 Advertising Benchmarks).
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Product description too vague | "We sell software" | Ask for 3 specific benefits and target audience |
| Character limit violations | Copy exceeds platform limits | Auto-trim and flag; offer shorter alternatives |
| No differentiation possible | Generic product | Ask for competitor names to identify differentiation angles |
| Regulated industry | Healthcare, finance, legal | Flag compliance requirements; avoid claims that need disclaimers |
| Multiple products in one request | User wants ads for everything | Recommend one ad group per product; start with highest-priority |
