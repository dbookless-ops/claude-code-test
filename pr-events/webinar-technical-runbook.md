# Webinar Technical Runbook

Generates a complete production runbook for webinars and virtual events — covering technical setup, rehearsal protocols, live-day operations, troubleshooting procedures, and post-event follow-up workflows.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~20-45 min sending / implementing.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is webinar details. Output is a Markdown runbook. No system access needed.

## User Intent Mapping

This skill should trigger when the user says things like:

- "Create a runbook for our webinar next week" (direct request)
- "What's the technical checklist for running a webinar?" (checklist)
- "How do we avoid technical issues during the webinar?" (prevention)
- "Rehearsal plan for our virtual event" (preparation)
- "What to do if the speaker's audio drops mid-webinar" (troubleshooting)
- "Post-webinar follow-up process" (after-event)
- "We've never run a webinar — give us the full playbook" (first-timer)
- "Webinar production guide for our team" (team documentation)
- "Zoom webinar setup checklist" (platform-specific)
- "On-demand replay setup after the live webinar" (post-production)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Webinar Topic | Text | Title and subject of the webinar |
| Date/Time | Text | Date, time, timezone, and duration |
| Platform | Text | Zoom, Webex, GoToWebinar, Teams, Livestorm, custom |
| Format | Text | Solo presenter, panel, interview, demo, workshop |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No media list?** Search "[your industry] journalists" on Twitter/X or use Google News to find reporters covering your space.
- **No event details?** Define: date, location, expected attendees, budget range, and primary goal. That's enough to start.
- **No press release history?** Describe your company, product, and the newsworthy event. This skill generates the release from scratch.
- **No attendee data?** Start with your CRM contacts tagged as "event interest" or your email list segments.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Speakers | Text | Names, roles, technical comfort level |
| Expected Attendance | Number | Registered count and expected show rate |
| Interactive Elements | Text | Q&A, polls, chat, breakout rooms, handouts |
| Recording Plan | Text | Record + on-demand, live only, no recording |
| Team Roles | Text | Who's producing, moderating, monitoring chat |
| Integration | Text | CRM, marketing automation for registration/follow-up |
| Previous Issues | Text | Problems from past webinars to prevent |

## Process

### Step 1: Pre-Event Setup (1-2 weeks before)

**Technical Setup Checklist:**
- Platform configuration (registration page, email confirmations, reminders)
- Presenter permissions and roles
- Branding (virtual background, waiting room, lower thirds)
- Registration form fields (for lead capture)
- CRM/marketing automation integration (registrant sync)
- Backup recording setup (platform recording + local backup)
- Test all interactive features (polls, Q&A, chat settings)

**Content Preparation:**
- Slides finalized and uploaded to platform
- Pre-built polls with answer options
- Q&A seed questions (in case audience is quiet)
- Handout/resource links ready
- Speaker bios and introduction scripts

### Step 2: Rehearsal Protocol (2-3 days before)

**Dry Run Checklist:**
- Full run-through with all speakers (45-60 min)
- Test each speaker's audio, video, and screen share
- Practice transitions between speakers
- Test polls, Q&A, and interactive elements
- Verify recording works (start/stop test)
- Review backup plans for each failure scenario
- Confirm roles: who introduces, moderates, monitors chat, handles tech

### Step 3: Day-of Run-of-Show

**Pre-Show (60 min before):**
- Producer opens platform, verifies settings
- Speakers join 30 min early for final sound/video check
- Load slides, open polls, prepare Q&A panel
- Start recording (both platform and local backup)
- Final comms check between producer and speakers

**During Show:**
- Opening: welcome slide with music, start 2 min after scheduled time
- Introduction: moderator introduces speakers (scripted, 2 min)
- Content: speakers present per rehearsed flow
- Engagement: launch polls at planned intervals
- Q&A: moderator filters and sequences questions
- Close: CTA, next steps, thank you

**Post-Show (immediately after):**
- Stop recording
- Export attendee list and engagement data
- Export Q&A log and chat transcript
- Speaker debrief (5 min)

### Step 4: Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Detection | Fix | Backup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speaker audio drops | Moderator monitors | Speaker: reconnect, switch to phone dial-in | Co-host narrates slides while speaker reconnects |
| Screen share fails | Audience can't see slides | Switch presenter, reshare | Upload slides to chat, narrate verbally |
| Platform crashes | Complete outage | Switch to backup Zoom link (pre-configured) | Send email with new link + delay notice |
| Low attendance | <20% show rate | Continue — recording will reach more people | Promote replay aggressively |
| Troll/disruption | Inappropriate chat messages | Mute/remove participant, disable chat if needed | Pre-configure: attendees chat to panelists only |
| Recording fails | No recording indicator | Start backup recording immediately | Ask speakers to re-record key sections after |

### Step 5: Post-Event Follow-Up

**Within 24 hours:**
- Send thank-you email to attendees (with recording link, slides, resources)
- Send "sorry we missed you" email to registrants who didn't attend (with replay link)
- Sync attendee data to CRM with engagement scores
- Share Q&A log with sales team (for follow-up)

**Within 48 hours:**
- Publish recording as on-demand (gate with form for new viewers)
- Create social clips from key moments
- Update landing page from "register" to "watch replay"
- Sales follow-up on hot leads (engaged attendees, high-value questions)

**Within 1 week:**
- Publish performance report (registrations, attendance, engagement, pipeline generated)
- Team debrief and lessons learned
- Plan follow-up content based on top Q&A themes


### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Conduct the full rehearsal — never skip it. Most webinar failures are preventable with a proper dry run. Test the exact setup each speaker will use on webinar day.


> **Benchmark Context**: See Cision 2024 State of the Media Report, and Bizzabo 2024 Event Marketing Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Unknown platform | User hasn't chosen a platform yet | Provide platform-agnostic checklist, recommend based on needs |
| Solo operator | One person doing everything | Prioritize critical tasks, recommend recruiting one helper minimum |
| First webinar ever | Team has no experience | Provide extra detail, recommend a practice webinar (internal only) |
| Complex format | Multi-day event or hybrid | Focus on one day/format, note that full production needs more planning |

## How to Get Your Data

No data export needed. Bring:
- Webinar topic, date, and platform
- Speaker names and their technical comfort level
- Expected attendance
- Team members available to help produce
- Any interactive elements planned (polls, Q&A, demos)

## Example

**Input**: "Q1 Product Launch Webinar" on Zoom Webinars, March 20 at 1pm ET, 60 minutes. Panel format: CEO + VP Product + Customer guest. Expected 400 registrants, 150 live. Interactive: 3 polls, live Q&A, product demo. Team: 1 producer, 1 moderator, 1 chat monitor.

**Output**: Complete runbook with 32-item pre-event checklist (platform config, integration with HubSpot, slide prep, rehearsal scheduling). Rehearsal plan for March 18 (full dry run with all 3 panelists). Day-of run-of-show: 12:00pm producer opens room → 12:30pm speakers join → 12:55pm recording starts → 1:00pm welcome slide → 1:02pm CEO intro → 1:15pm VP Product demo → 1:35pm customer story → 1:45pm Q&A → 1:58pm CTA + close. Troubleshooting for 6 scenarios. Post-event: replay email within 4 hours, sales handoff within 24 hours, on-demand page live within 48 hours.
