  "event checklist", "conference planning", "event coordination plan", "run of show document",
  "event timeline", "trade show logistics", "vendor coordination for event", "event day
  runbook", "contingency plan for event", or "event planning checklist". Also trigger when

# Event Logistics Coordinator

Builds a comprehensive event logistics plan including timeline with milestones, vendor coordination checklist, day-of run-of-show, staffing assignments, and contingency plans. Covers pre-event, day-of, and post-event operations.

## Granularity Check

> Can this be completed in a single Claude session? **Yes — expect ~5 min data prep → ~10 min Claude session → ~120-240 min coordinating across vendors.** If implementing output in a platform, add 10-20 min for setup. Input is event details. Output is a Markdown logistics plan. No external tool access needed.

## User Intent Mapping

This skill should trigger when the user says things like:

- "Help me plan the logistics for our user conference" (direct request)
- "Create an event day run-of-show" (specific deliverable)
- "What's the checklist for a trade show booth?" (event type specific)
- "Build a timeline for our product launch event" (milestone planning)
- "Coordinate vendors for the annual summit" (vendor management)
- "What could go wrong at this event?" (contingency planning)
- "Staff assignments for the conference" (resource allocation)
- "Pre-event checklist — what am I forgetting?" (completeness check)
- "Post-event follow-up plan" (after-event operations)
- "Plan a 200-person workshop from scratch" (end-to-end planning)

## Input Contract

### Required Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Event Type | Text | Conference, trade show, workshop, webinar, product launch, user group, dinner |
| Event Date | Text | Date(s) of the event |
| Expected Attendance | Number | Approximate headcount |
| Event Goals | Text | Lead generation, brand awareness, customer engagement, product launch |

### If You Don't Have This Data

- **No media list?** Search "[your industry] journalists" on Twitter/X or use Google News to find reporters covering your space.
- **No event details?** Define: date, location, expected attendees, budget range, and primary goal. That's enough to start.
- **No press release history?** Describe your company, product, and the newsworthy event. This skill generates the release from scratch.
- **No attendee data?** Start with your CRM contacts tagged as "event interest" or your email list segments.

### Optional Inputs

| Input | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Venue | Text | Venue name/type or "virtual" |
| Budget | Number | Total event budget |
| Staff Available | Number | Team members available for event duties |
| Speakers/Sessions | Text | Agenda outline if known |
| Vendors Confirmed | Text | Caterers, AV, printers, etc. already booked |
| Previous Event Notes | Text | Learnings from past events |

## Process

### Step 1: Master Timeline
Build a countdown timeline:
- **12-8 weeks out**: Venue, budget, vendor RFPs, speaker invitations
- **8-4 weeks out**: Registration launch, content creation, vendor confirmations
- **4-2 weeks out**: Attendee communications, print materials, rehearsals
- **2-1 weeks out**: Final confirmations, packing lists, staff briefing
- **Week of**: Setup, tech checks, dry runs
- **Day of**: Run-of-show execution
- **Post-event**: Follow-up, debrief, reporting

### Step 2: Vendor Coordination
For each vendor category:
- Contact and contract status
- Deliverable due dates
- Day-of requirements (setup time, power, space)
- Payment schedule
- Backup vendor identified

### Step 3: Run-of-Show
Minute-by-minute day-of schedule:
- Setup and load-in timeline
- Registration/doors open
- Session start/end times with buffer
- Meal/break timing
- Speaker transitions and AV cues
- Teardown and load-out

### Step 4: Staff Assignments
Role-based assignment matrix:
- Registration desk
- Speaker/VIP liaison
- AV/tech support
- Social media/photography
- Attendee support
- Vendor coordination
- Emergency contact

### Step 5: Contingency Planning
For each critical risk:
- Speaker cancels (backup speaker, recorded content)
- AV failure (backup equipment, alternate format)
- Low attendance (right-size rooms, adjust catering)
- Weather/venue issue (indoor backup, virtual pivot)
- Wi-Fi failure (mobile hotspot, offline materials)


### Confidence & Sample Size
> **Confidence Note**: Results are only as reliable as your input data. Small datasets (<50 records or <30 days of data) produce directional insights, not statistically significant conclusions. Always note your sample size when sharing results with stakeholders. Recommendations should be validated with A/B testing or additional data before making major strategic changes.

### ⚠️ Human Checkpoint
> Review the run-of-show with all key stakeholders (venue, AV, speakers) at least 1 week before the event. Walk the venue if possible.


> **Benchmark Context**: See Cision 2024 State of the Media Report, and Bizzabo 2024 Event Marketing Report for current industry benchmarks relevant to this analysis.

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Google Docs (Collaboration)

2. Paste the output content
3. Use Suggesting Mode for stakeholder review
4. Share with PR team and executives for approval

### Notion / Confluence
1. Create a new page in your team workspace
2. Paste Markdown output directly
3. Add status trackers for action items
4. Link to related event pages or campaign briefs

### Email Distribution
1. Copy the finalized output
2. Format for email distribution to media contacts
3. Use your PR tool (Muck Rack, Cision) for targeted sends
4. Track opens and pickups

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Vague event details | User hasn't decided on format/venue | Build flexible plan with decision points flagged |
| Virtual vs. in-person ambiguity | User says "event" without specifying | Ask — logistics differ dramatically |
| First-time event planner | User doesn't know what they don't know | Use comprehensive checklist, flag items they likely haven't considered |
| Very large event (1000+) | Complexity exceeds single-session scope | Focus on critical-path items, recommend professional event management |

## How to Get Your Data

No data export needed. Bring:
- Event date, type, and expected attendance
- Venue details (or whether you need help selecting)
- Budget (even approximate)
- Any vendors already booked
- Agenda outline (even rough)
- Team member count available for event duties

## Example

**Input**: Product launch event, March 15, 2026, 150 attendees, hotel conference room, $25K budget, 6 staff available. Sessions: keynote, 3 breakout sessions, networking reception. Goal: generate pipeline from prospect attendees.

**Output**: 12-week countdown timeline with 47 tasks. Vendor tracker for catering, AV, signage, photographer. Run-of-show: 8am setup → 9am registration → 9:30 keynote (45 min) → 10:30 breakouts (3 parallel, 40 min each) → 12pm lunch → 1pm demo stations → 2:30pm closing → 3pm networking reception → 5pm teardown. 6 staff assigned across registration (2), speaker liaison (1), AV (1), demo stations (1), photography/social (1). Top 5 contingency plans. Post-event: lead capture sync to CRM within 24 hours, follow-up email sequence within 48 hours.
