## AP Style Quick Reference

| Element | AP Style Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Numbers | Spell out 1-9, use numerals 10+; except money ($5M), percentages (3%), time (2 p.m.) always numerals |
| Abbreviations | Use only standard abbreviations; spell out states first mention, then use postal code |
| Titles | Capitalize formal titles before names (CEO Jane Smith); lowercase after name (Jane Smith, chief executive officer) |
| Dates | Month Day, Year format (April 15, 2026); not April 15th |
| Companies | Use official legal name first mention, then acceptable short name; capitalize all formal names |
| URLs | Remove "https://www." — use "example.com" not "https://www.example.com" |
| Quotes | Use double quotes for direct quotes; single for quotes within quotes. Attribution after quote: "Quote," said Person. |
| Punctuation | No serial comma (Oxford comma avoided in AP); em dashes for clarity; semicolons sparingly |
| Hyphens | Use for compound adjectives before noun: "revenue-generating product" but "product generates revenue" |

## Platform Implementation Steps

### Email Distribution

2. Format for email distribution to media contacts
3. Use your PR tool (Muck Rack, Cision) for targeted sends
4. Track opens and pickups

## Failure Modes

| Scenario | Symptom | Resolution |
|----------|---------|------------|
| No real news | Announcement reads like puff piece | Flag: "This lacks newsworthy angle." Suggest: "What changed? What's the impact?" Reframe around customer benefit, market shift, or measurable outcome |
| Quote sounds fake | "This quote doesn't sound like real person." | Ask for original quote from executive; provide quote template/suggestions; option to generate natural-sounding quote based on talking points |
| Unclear key facts | Reader doesn't understand what's being announced | Ask to rank key facts by importance; reorder paragraphs; move critical context up |
| Embargo too soon | "Embargo time already passed when I see this" | Set embargo to future date (minimum 24 hours ahead); suggest coordinating with journalist outreach timing |
| No distribution list | "Where do I send this?" | Generate default list based on announcement type; ask for target publications; provide journalist contact research guidance |
| Company boilerplate missing | "We don't have official company description" | Provide template; ask for core facts (founding year, mission, key products, notable clients); draft generic version |

## How to Get Your Data

**Press Release Raw Materials:**

**News Angle (Required):**
- Answer: "What changed in the world because of this announcement?"
- If funding: How much? Who led? What's the use of proceeds?
- If product: What problem does it solve? What's unique?
- If partnership: Who are the partners? What's the mutual benefit?
- If award: What achievement is being recognized?

**Executive Quotes:**
- Email executives: "Please provide 1-2 sentences on [specific angle]"
- Use frameworks: "Why this matters to customers" / "What this enables" / "What success looks like"
- Examples:
  - Founder quote: Strategic vision, mission alignment
  - Partner quote: External validation, mutual benefit
  - Customer quote: Real-world impact (if possible)

**Key Facts:**
- From: Financial data, product specs, timeline, market positioning
- Checklist: Size of announcement (funding $ or user count), credibility markers (who's backing), customer impact, timeline
- Tip: List 8-10 facts, then rank top 5 by newsworthiness

**Target Media:**
- By type: Tech media (TechCrunch, VentureBeat), business (Forbes, Wall Street Journal), industry-specific (Cannabis Business Times, Fintech Magazine)
- By journalist beat: Search "reporter [topic]", check their recent bylines
- Tools: Muck Rack, Cision, PitchDB for contact research
- Alternative: Newswire services (PR Newswire, eWire) can handle distribution for fee

**Boilerplate:**
- Template: "[Company] is a [category] company founded in [year] by [founders]. [Company description]. [Key achievements/market position]. Learn more at [URL]."
- Keep to 3-4 sentences; update quarterly with latest milestones
